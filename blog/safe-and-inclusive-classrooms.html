title: Safe and Inclusive Classrooms

<div id="safe-and-inclusive-classrooms">
  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p>I recently took the additional qualification course called <a href ="https://coursesforteachers.ca/courses/CONT671">Inclusive Classroom, Part 1</a>. For each of the six modules in the course, I chose an artifact, either a video or an article, that I chose to further reflect on.</p>
  <p>An inclusive classroom is exactly what it sounds like â€“ it is a classroom that is designed to be inclusive to its students. There are different types of inclusion, such as academic inclusion, emotional inclusion, and social inclusion. A teacher in an inclusive classroom incorporates various strategies to ensure that all their students are truly included.  </p>
