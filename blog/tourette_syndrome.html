  <h2>What is Tourette Syndrome?</h2>
    <p>Tourette Syndrome, commonly known as Tourette's or TS, is form of tic disorder. Tic disorders are neuropsychiatric disorder that involve involuntary movements called "tics". The urge to do a tic can be compared to needing to gasp for air after holding your breath.</p>
    <p>Tics are either physical or vocal and individuals with TS have several kinds of tics in both categories. Tics can start occurring any time before the age of 18. They are lifelong and there are no known cures for them. Tics may sometimes look controllable, but are not. Tics change in appearance, frequency, severity, and intensity over time. One kind of tic may disappear only to be replaced by another kind.</p>

  <h2>Examples of Tics</h2>
    <p>Physical – Simple</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eye blinking</li>
      <li>Grimacing</li>
      <li>Nose Twitching</li>
      <li>Leg and finger movements</li>
      <li>Arm and head jerks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Physical – Complex</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hopping</li>
      <li>Clapping</li>
      <li>Throwing</li>
      <li>Touching</li>
      <li>Holding funny expressions</li>

      <li>Kissing</li>
      <li>Pinching</li>
      <li>Tearing papers<li>
    </ul>

    <p>Vocal – Simple</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coughing</li>
      <li>Whistling</li>
      <li>Animal noises</li>
      <li>Throat clearing</li>
      <li>Sniffing</li>
      <li>Grunting</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Coprolalia: Rude and inappropriate language (not directed to anyone in particular)</li>
      <li>Echolalia: Repeated words or phrases</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Environmental Factors That Impact Tics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stress</li>
      <li>Anxiety</li>
      <li>Excitement</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Holidays</li>
      <li>Illness</li>
      <li>Vacations</li>
      <li>Hunger</li>
      <li>Life and school transitions</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What Teachers Should Know</h2>
    <p><strong>Do not force students to suppress tics!</strong> When they suppress their tics, they use all of their focus and energy, making it hard to do other tasks at the same time. Suppressing tics causes a buildup that will later lead to an outburst of tics.</p>
    <p>Tourette's is often comorbid with ADHD and OCD.</p>
    <p>Tics become more manageable when the student is engaged in an activity.</p>

  <h2>Classroom Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Give frequent breaks to provide opportunity for movement.</li>
      <li>Arrange a safe place (not a hallway or washroom!) for the student to go when the tics are severe. Arrange a signal for the student to use to go there.</li>
    <li>Give preferential seating (e.g. mid-back of the room, not near a window, and close to the teacher's desk).</li>
    <li>Explicitly teach coping strategies to use when they feel teased or bullied.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>School Strategies</h2>
    <p>Educate the entire school about TS. The student will have a much easier time at school if everyone they come in contact with knows about TS. A school-wide in-service can be provided (with the parents' permission). When staff and students are informed about TS, they can prevent situations that harm the student (e.g. asking the student to stop making noises). Peer training can also significantly reduce bullying. Acceptance and understanding from everyone can help the student accept themself.</p> 

  <h2>Accommodations and Modifications</h2>
    <p>Accommodations For Written Work</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow use of computer and/or scribe.</li>
      <li>Replace written components with oral components.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Accommodations For Tests/Exams</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrange an individual or small group setting to write in.</li>
        <li>Allow as much time as possible.</li>
        <li>Allow music or white noise to listen to.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Reducing Stressful Situations</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow student to leave class early to avoid crowded hallways.</li>
        <li>Arrange a safe place with staff support to go to during unstructured time (e.g. before the first bell, recess/breaks, lunch, spare period etc.).</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Improving Productivity</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build their schedule around their most productive times of the day.</li>
      </ul>
