  <h2>ELL Terminology</h3>
  
    <p>ELL – English Language Learner. Sometimes known as ESL (English as a Second Language). </p>
    <p>L1 – A learner's first language, learned natively.</p>
    <p>L2 – A learner's second language, not learned natively.</p>
    <p>BICS – Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills. This is a measure of how well ELLs can participate in and understand everyday conversations. </p>
    <p>CALP – Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency. This is a measure of how well ELLs can produce and understand language unique to academic fields. </p>
    <p>ZPD – Zone of Proximal Development. This contains what a learner is able to do only when they have guidance. Learning takes place when a learner is further developing the skills within their ZPD.</p>

  <h2>Questions From Non-English-Speaking Parents of ELLs</h2>
    
    <h3>Should I keep teaching my child to read and write in our first language?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! The stronger your child's skills are in their first language, the greater their ability to learn their second language. It's difficult for ELLs to learn concepts in English that they have yet to learn in their first language.</p>
  
    <h3>Should I encourage my child to use English at home as much as possible?</h3>
    <p>This is a nice idea as long as it doesn't impede on the development of their first language. Please keep in mind that improvement in English will be minimal unless they are surrounded by proficient speakers, so if you speak to your child in your first language, their English development will be minimal. If you wish to help your child learn English at home, one of the most useful things to do would be to help them increase their vocabulary.</p>
  
    <h3>My child is completely new to learning English. What can I expect?</h3>
    <p>The older your child is, the faster they will need to learn vocabulary and grammar to catch up with their peers. English-speaking children enter Kindergarten with roughly 1000 word families in their repertoire, and they learn 1000 more word families every year. If your child enters Kindergarten knowing no English, they will be 1000 words behind. If your child enters the Canadian school system later on knowing no English, they will be several thousands of words behind. Your child is capable of catching up, but they will be expected to learn at a faster rate than their peers.</p>

  <h2>Questions From Teachers of ELLs</h2>
  
    <h3>Should I correct my ELLs' English mistakes?</h3>
    <p>Children naturally acquire language with little or no overt teaching, so I would suggest keeping corrections to a minimal, especially when it is something beyond the ELL's level of understanding. Correcting too excessively can also frustrate the ELL and discourage them from making mistakes, even though making mistakes is vital to learning. Keep in mind that some skills that English-speakers find easy, ELLs will find more difficult, due to interferences from their first language, such as the pronunciation of new sounds (e.g. soft "th", hard "th", "v", "w", "l", and "r"). Correcting mistakes are effective when the ELL can easily understand why they are mistakes, and can easily fix them. </p>
   
    <h3>Can I expect my ELLs to understand the subject-specific terminology to the same extent as other students?</h3>
    <p>ELLs need to understand the basics of English grammar before being able to work with subject-specific terminology. If they have not learned the subject-specific terminology in their first language, they will benefit from doing that first, so they have something to latch on to. They may be able to learn subject-specific terminologies in English without knowing what they are called in their first language, but they should be able to explain them with their language. </p>
  
    <h3>Should I insist on my ELLs only speaking in English in my classroom?</h3>
    <p>Discouraging the use of ELLs' first languages can severely impact how the ELLs feels about your class. They may feel like you are not appreciating their background and culture. ELLs need to be exposed to lots of English and have plenty of time to practice it, so the use of their L1 should be minimal, but banning it may make them feel like they are not welcome in your classroom. An ELL's first language can be the most useful resource when they are learning new concepts in English, so I would recommend allowing them to use their first languages to help them understand new concepts in English. </p>
