  <h2>Questions From Parents of English-learning Students</h2>
    
    <h3>Should I keep teaching my child to read and write in our first langauge?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! The stronger your child's skills are in their first language, the greater their ability to learn their second language. It's difficult for ELLs to learn concepts in English that they have yet to learn in their first language.</p>
  
    <h3>Should I encourage my child to speak in Engish at home as much as possible?</h3>
    <p>This is a nice idea as long as it doesn't impede on the development on their first language. I would actually suggest that they practice only their first language at home with you, since they have all day in school to practice their English. Their improvement in English at home will be minimal unless they are surrounded by proficient speakers. If you wish to help your child learn English at home, one of the most useful things to do would be to help them increase their vocabulary. You ask them to find out how to translate words into English.</p>
  
    <h3>My child is completely new to learning English. What can I expect?</h3>
    <p>The older your child is, the faster they will need to learn vocabulary and grammar to catch up with their peers. English-speaking children enter Kindergarten with roughly 1000 word families in their repetoire, and they learn 1000 more word families every year. If your child enters Kindergarten knowing no English, they will be 1000 words behind. If your child enters the Canadian school system later on knowing no English, they will be several thousands of words behind. </p>

  <h2>Questions From Teachers of English-learning Students</h2>
  
    <h3>Should I correct my ELLs' Engish mistakes?</h3>
    <p>Children natually acquire language with little or no overt teaching, so I would suggest keeping corrections to a minimal, especially when it is something beyond the child's level of understanding. Correcting too excessively can also frustrate the student and discourage them from making mistakes. Keep in mind that some things that English-speakers find easy, ELLs will find more difficult, due to interferences from their first language, such as the pronuncuation of new sounds (e.g. soft "th", hard "th", "v", "w", "l", and "r"). </p>
   
    <h3>Can I expect my ELL to understand the subject-specific terminology to the same extent as other students?</h3>
    <p>Students need to understand the basics English grammar before being able to work with subject-specific terminology. If they have not learned the subject-specific terminology in their first language, they will benefit from doing that first, so they have something to latch on to.</p>
  
    <h3>Should I insist on my ELLs only speaking in English in my classroom?</h3>
    <p>Discouraging the use of ELLs' first languages can severly impact how the ELL feels about your class. They may feel like you are not appreciating their background and culture. ELLs need to be exposed to lots of English and have plenty of time to practice it, so the use of their first langauge should be minimal, but banning it may not solve any issues </p>

  <h3>Terminology</h3>
  <p>ELL – English Language Learner.</p>
  <p>L1 – A learner's first language, learned natively.</p>
  <p>L2 – A learner's second language, not learned natively.</p>
  <p>BICS – Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills. These include langauge used in everday conversations. </p>
  <p>CALP – Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency. This includes language used in academia. </p>
  <p>ZPD – Zone of Proximal Development. This contain what a learner is able to do only when they have guidance. Learning takes place when a learner is developing skills within their ZPD, often with instruction.</p>
