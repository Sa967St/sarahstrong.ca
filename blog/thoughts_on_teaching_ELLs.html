  <h2>Terminology</h3>
  <p>ELL – English Language Learner.</p>
  <p>L1 – A learner's first language, learned natively.</p>
  <p>L2 – A learner's second language, not learned natively.</p>
  <p>BICS – Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills. These include langauge used in everyday conversations. </p>
  <p>CALP – Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency. This includes language used in academia. </p>
  <p>ZPD – Zone of Proximal Development. This contains what a learner is able to do only when they have guidance. Learning takes place when a learner is developing skills within their ZPD, often with instruction.</p>

  <h2>Questions From Parents of ELLs</h2>
    
    <h3>Should I keep teaching my child to read and write in our first language?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! The stronger your child's skills are in their L1, the greater their ability to learn their second language. It's difficult for ELLs to learn concepts in English that they have yet to learn in their L1.</p>
  
    <h3>Should I encourage my child to use English at home as much as possible?</h3>
    <p>This is a nice idea as long as it doesn't impede on the development of their L1. Please keep in mind that improvement in English will be minimal unless they are surrounded by proficient speakers, so if you speak to your child in both your L1 and English, their English development will be minimal. If you wish to help your child learn English at home, one of the most useful things to do would be to help them increase their vocabulary, since this can be done without being surrounded by proficient English speakers.</p>
  
    <h3>My child is completely new to learning English. What can I expect?</h3>
    <p>The older your child is, the faster they will need to learn vocabulary and grammar to catch up with their peers. English-speaking children enter Kindergarten with roughly 1000 word families in their repertoire, and they learn 1000 more word families every year. If your child enters Kindergarten knowing no English, they will be 1000 words behind. If your child enters the Canadian school system later on knowing no English, they will be several thousands of words behind. Your child is capable of catching up, but they will be expected to learn at a faster rate than their peers.</p>

  <h2>Questions From Teachers of ELLs</h2>
  
    <h3>Should I correct my ELLs' English mistakes?</h3>
    <p>Children naturally acquire language with little or no overt teaching, so I would suggest keeping corrections to a minimal, especially when it is something beyond the ELL's level of understanding. Correcting too excessively can also frustrate the ELL and discourage them from making mistakes, even though making mistakes is vital to learning. Keep in mind that some skills that English-speakers find easy, ELLs will find more difficult, due to interferences from their L1, such as the pronunciation of new sounds (e.g. soft "th", hard "th", "v", "w", "l", and "r"). Correcting mistakes are effective when the ELL can easily understand why they are mistakes, and can easily fix them. These kinds of mistakes would be within the ELL's ZPD. </p>
   
    <h3>Can I expect my ELLs to understand the subject-specific terminology to the same extent as other students?</h3>
    <p>ELLs need to understand the basics of English grammar (called BICS) before being able to work with subject-specific terminology (called CALP). If they have not learned the subject-specific terminology in their L1, they will benefit from doing that first, so they have something to latch on to. They may be able to learn subject-specific terminologies in English without knowing what they are called in their L1, but they should be able to explain them with their L1. </p>
  
    <h3>Should I insist on my ELLs only speaking in English in my classroom?</h3>
    <p>Discouraging the use of ELLs' L1 can severely impact how the ELLs feels about your class. They may feel like you are not appreciating their background and culture. ELLs need to be exposed to lots of English and have plenty of time to practice it, so the use of their L1 should be minimal, but banning it may make them feel like they are not welcome in your classroom. An ELL's L1 can be the most useful resource when they are learning new concepts in English, so I would recommend allowing them to use their L1s to help them understand new concepts in English. </p>
