  <h2>What Resilience Is </h2>
     <p>Resilience is the ability to rebuild and grow from adversity. It is a trait that every human is capable of developing. For children, the key for developing resilience is having caring and supportive relationships with adults </p>
 
  <h2>Social and Emotional Learning</h2>   
     <p>Social and emotional learning (SEL) is the process through which people acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. SEL skills are necessary for effective life functioning. Developing SEL skills is also strongly linked to developing resiliency. </p>
