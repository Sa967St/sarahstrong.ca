  <h1>Inclusive Classrooms</h1>
  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p>I recently took the AQ (additional qualification) course <a href ="https://coursesforteachers.ca/courses/CONT671">Inclusive Classroom, Part 1</a>. For each of the six modules in the course, I chose an artifact, either a video or an article, that I chose to further reflect on.</p>
  <p>An inclusive classroom is exactly what it sounds like – it is a classroom that is designed to be inclusive to each of its students. It is a safe, welcoming space where students can thrive. The teacher of an inclusive classroom incorporates various strategies to ensure that all their students are included academically, emotionally, and socially. </p>

  <h2>The Purpose of Inclusion (Module 1)</h2>
     <h3>Artifact: Shelley Moore - What is Inclusion?</h3>
     <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1fbTKYkU4k"> </iframe>
     <p>Shelley Moore is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Colombia. She is a former special education teacher, researcher, speaker, and storyteller. She wrote the book <i>One Without the Other: Stories of Unity Through Diversity and Inclusion</i> in 2016 and is currently writing her second book, <i>All for One: Designing Individual Education Plans for Inclusive Classrooms</i>, which is set to be released in February 2021.</p>
     <p>Many of Shelley's professional talks can be found on YouTube. This video is an introduction to inclusion, which is a common theme throughout her talks. She discusses how when she was teaching special education for the first time, she wanted to make her students feel included within their school community so she tried to bring them to the school rally. She thought that making them attend was the same thing as including them and frequently preached "we're inclusive!" along the way. While she was bringing them to the rally, she had an important revelation: "What is the students' purpose in being at the rally"?. The students didn't want to go, so was forcing them to do actually an inclusive practice? She decided it wasn't, so she turned them around and brought them back to the classroom.</p>
     <p>Her message is that when teachers are trying to be inclusive, an important question to ask is "what is the purpose for each student?". If we can't answer this question for each of our students, then it's likely that the students are not truly included.</p>
     <p>Later on in the AQ course, I learned some new terminology to help articulate different ways in which students are included: social inclusion, emotional inclusion, and academic inclusion. In the classroom, students need to be included socially (e.g. participating in meaningful collaboration), emotionally (e.g feeling safe in their learning space), and academically (e.g. learning challenging content that is just right for them in engaging ways). </p> 
 
  <h2>Universal Design for Learning (Module 2)</h2>  
     <h3>Artifact: Shelley Moore - Sweeper Van</h3>
     <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yjjz8iHj5hY"> </iframe>
     <p>Another Shelley Moore talk? Yup. In this one, she shares a story about a fundraiser she participated in and how it related to one of the most important pedagogical concepts: universal design for learning. The fundraiser was a two-day bicycle marathon from Vancouver to Seattle and most of the participants trained for a few months to prepare for it. Shelley was one of the participants who chose not to train. On the first day of the race, she grew tired quickly and felt like giving up. She took a break on the side of the rode and was worried about being stranded. The sweeper van, speficially designed to pick up the stragglers, picked up Shelley and drove her to the next checkpoint. On the second day, she rode her bicycle more confidently because she knew that if she didn't make it, the sweeper van would come picker her up. It did, and it stopped just short of the finish line so that Shelley could cross it on her bicycle. </p>
     <p> I found some parts of the story to be strange. I can understand how the sweeper van ensures that no one is left stranded, just like how universal design is about ensuring that all students are reached, but it does seem like the sweeper van provided <i>too much</i> support. It essentially did the marathon for her. Shelley brought up this point after telling her story, and her justification was that the point of the marathon wasn't to bike, it was to raise money. It was also a deep learning experience for her, and boy did she learn to train for next time!</p>
     <p>Regardless of whether you beleive Shelley deserved to cross the finish line, there is something to learn from her talk.</p>

  <h2>Resilience (Module 4)</h2>
     <h3>Artifact: <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/ww_bolstering_students.pdf">Bolstering Resilience in Students: Teachers as Protective Factors</a> by Kingsley Hurlington</h3>
     <p>On March 20, 2019, the education minister of Ontario, Lisa Thompson, claimed that increasing high school class sizes will benefit students by making them more <strong>resilient</strong>. This was a highly controversial statement that received backlash from the media. Many people pointed out that resilience doesn't work that way and they voiced their concerns about the dangers of this misbelief. </p>
     <p>According to the monograph <i>Bolstering Resilience in Students: Teachers as Protective Factors</i> by Kingsley Hurlington, resilience is "the capacity to return to good mental health after challenging and difficult situations." "[It] allows individuals to manage difficult episodes or chronic challenges in their lives."" The monograph discusses the research behind how children actually develop resilience. For example, "all children have the capacity to adapt to the challenges of life when they have the <strong>support</strong> they need."" <i>Support</i> is the key word here – we can't just put children in stressful situations and expect them to grow stronger from them all by themselves. So, what does support look like? According to Hurlington, "supportive environments feature caring relationships, high expectations, and opportunities for meaningful participation". Furthermore, "changing the life trajectories of children and youth from risk to resilience starts with changing the beliefs of the adults in their families, schools and community. In other words, developing resilience can't be done alone.</p>
     <p>This is important information for teachers to be aware of. Resilience is a life skill that is crucial to having a happy, successful life. If we want children to learn to be resilient, we need to support them by making our classrooms inclusive learning environments. You can't teach a child to swim by throwing them in the deep end without any life-saving equipment – they first need to get comfortable swimming in the shallow end, which might initally involve needing to wear water wings. Similarly, you can't teach a child to become resilient by taking away their supports and making it harder for them to communicate with their teachers.</p>
     <p>My biggest takeaway from this monograph was that any child can learn to become resilient, even if they grew up in challenging environment, but it can't be done unless they have at least one supportive adult, such as a caring teacher, in their life.</p>
    
  <h2>Growth Mindset (Module 5)</h2>
    <h3>Artifact: Carol Dweck - The Effect of Praise on Mindsets</h3>
    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTXrV0_3UjY"> </iframe>
    <p>If you're in the education industry, it's highly likely that you've heard the term "growth mindset". During my Bachelor of Education program, my professors said "growth mindset" so often that some of my classmates and I started guessing before each lecture how many times they would say it. It was usually between 3 and 16 times per lecture.</p>
    <p>Carol Dweck is the psychologist who coined the term "growth mindset". In 2006, she wrote the first edition of her book <i>Mindset: The new psychology of success</i>, which contained her research about the impact of believing that intelligence is malleable. The video <i>The Effect of Praise on Mindsets</i> is a nice summary of one of her experiements she discussed in her book.</p>
    <p>The video summarizes an experiment in which children are provided with puzzles. The children start off with simple puzzles and when they succeed they are either told that they are "smart at puzzles" or "work hard at puzzles". When they are given more challening puzzles, the children who were told they were smart were reluctant to do them, whereas the children who were told they worked hard were more eager to do challengig puzzles. The children who were told they were smart wanted affirmation that they were smart so they didn't want to try challenging puzzles that might cause them to struggle, whereas the children who were told they worked hard wanted to learn more and challenge themselves, even if it invovled making mistakes. In short, the students who were told they worked hard learned more from the activity and enjoyed it more than the students who were told they were smart.</p>
    <p>Depending on who you ask, the idea of a growth mindset is either profound or obvious. I'm on the "profound" side, the main reason being that many of us grew up believing that it's a kind gesture to call other people "smart" and "intelligence" and it's not obvious why this does not actually not support their growth until you hear or read about Dr. Dweck's research. Short videos such as this can immediately shed some light on lifelong misconceptions. For a teacher, it can have a major impact on their teaching and assessment practices.</p>
