  <h1> Safe and Inclusive Classrooms</h1>
  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p>I recently took the AQ (additional qualification) course <a href ="https://coursesforteachers.ca/courses/CONT671">Inclusive Classroom, Part 1</a>. For each of the six modules in the course, I chose an artifact, either a video or an article, that I chose to further reflect on.</p>
  <p>An inclusive classroom is exactly what it sounds like – it is a classroom that is designed to be inclusive to each of its students. It is a safe, welcoming space where students can thrive. The teacher of an inclusive classroom incorporates various strategies to ensure that all their students are included academically, emotionally, and socially. </p>

  <h2>The Purpose of Inclusion (Module 1)</h2>
     <h3>Artifact: Shelley Moore - What is Inclusion?</h3>
     <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1fbTKYkU4k"> </iframe>
     <p>Shelley Moore is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia. She is a researcher, speaker, storyteller, and formerly, a special education teacher. She wrote her first book, <i>One Without the Other: Stories of Unity Through Diversity and Inclusion</i>, in 2016 and is currently writing her second book, <i>All for One: Designing Individual Education Plans for Inclusive Classrooms</i>, which is set to be released in February 2021. Many of Shelley's professional talks can be found on YouTube. </p>
     <p>This video is an introduction to the idea of inclusion, which is a common theme throughout her talks. She discusses how when she was teaching special education for the first time, she wanted to make her students feel included within the school community so she tried to bring them to the school rally. She thought that making them attend was the same thing as including them. While she was bringing them to the rally, she had an important revelation: "What is the students' purpose in being at the rally?". The students didn't want to go, so was forcing them to go actually an inclusive practice? She decided it wasn't, so she turned them around and brought them back to the classroom.</p>
     <p>Her message is that when teachers are trying to be inclusive, an important question to ask is "what is the purpose for each student?". If we can't answer this question for each of our students, then it's likely that the students are not truly included. Participation often created the illusion of inclusion.</p>
     <p>Later in the AQ course, I learned some new terminology to help articulate different ways in which students are included: social inclusion, emotional inclusion, and academic inclusion. In the classroom, students need to be included socially (e.g. participating in meaningful collaboration), emotionally (e.g. feeling safe in their learning space), and academically (e.g. learning challenging content that is just right for them in engaging ways). </p> 
 
  <h2>Universal Design for Learning (Module 2)</h2>  
     <h3>Artifact: Shelley Moore - Sweeper Van</h3>
     <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yjjz8iHj5hY"> </iframe>
     <p>Another Shelley Moore talk? Yup. In this one, she shares a story about a fundraiser she participated in and how it related to one of the most important pedagogical concepts: universal design for learning. The fundraiser was a two-day bicycle marathon from Vancouver to Seattle and most of the participants trained for a few months to prepare for it. Shelley was one of the participants who chose not to train. On the first day of the marathon, she grew tired quickly and felt like giving up. She took a break on the side of the rode and was worried about being stranded. The sweeper van, specifically designed to pick up the stragglers, picked up Shelley and drove her to the half-way checkpoint. On the second day, she rode her bicycle more confidently because she knew that if she didn't make it, the sweeper van would come picker her up. It did, and it stopped just short of the finish line so that Shelley could cross the finish line on her bicycle.</p>
     <p>I found some parts of the story to be strange. I can understand how the sweeper van ensures that no one is left stranded, just like how universal design is about ensuring that all students are reached, but it does seem like the sweeper van provided <i>too much</i> support – It essentially did the marathon for her. Shelley brought up this point after telling her story, and her justification was that the point of the marathon wasn't really the bike ride, it was to raise money. It was also a deep learning experience for her since she spent a lot of time reflecting about herself during and after the marathon.</p>
     <p>At the end of her talk, she asked the question "What is the sweeper van in your classroom?". Regardless of whether you believe Shelley deserved to cross the finish line the way she did, this is still a great question for teachers to think about. What strategies are you using to ensure that none your students are getting left behind? To what extend are you supporting students? Are all your students truly being included?</p>
     
  <h2>The Impact of Inclusion (Module 3)</h2>
     <h3>Artifact: Disabling Segregation</h3>
     <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/izkN5vLbnw8"></iframe>
     <p>Dan Habib is a photojournalist and a disability-rights advocate. He was the director, producer, and cinematographer of the documentary <i>Including Samuel</i>, which came out in 2007. Samuel is his son, who was born with cerebral palsy and was bound to a wheelchair.</p>
     <p>In this talk, Dan shared how Samuel was included in all aspects of his life and how this inclusion benefited not just Samuel but everyone who grew up with him. Samuel was placed in mainstream classes instead of segreated special education classes. Samuel learned alongside his friends, even though he struggled to hold a pencil. Samuel was included in his school community and he participated in school activities such as school plays. Samuel participated in sports he loved, such as baseball. He started off in the tee-ball league and when he wanted to move up to the fast-pitch league, Dan and the coach provided accommodations so he could play – Samuel hit the ball off the tee and the coach pushed his wheelchair to first base. Samuel grew up with inclusion being normal, and as a result he is happy, high-achieving, and successful. Dan also shared the impact that Samuel had on his peers. Samuel grew up having many friends who adored him and advocated for him. They grew up with inclusion being normal for them too, and it has helped them become the kind, patient, and compassionate individuals they are today. </p>
     <p>Dan also shared some statistics about inclusive education. He cited research that indicates that students with special needs who are in mainstream education (as opposed to segregated special education programs) have better communication skills, higher academic achievements, wider social networks, and fewer behaviour problems. He suggests that the reason why most students with special needs in the USA are still in segregated special education classrooms, despite the research indicating that this doesn't yield better outcomes for them, is that it's often hard to make changes in society when something has been done the same way for a long time. He ends his talk with a profound message: "You can't teach inclusion – you have to live it and experience it."</p>
     <p>I found Samuel's story to be inspiring. One of the messages I got from Dan's talk is that an inclusive classroom with a mix of students with and without disabilities can have a profound impact on all of them. The benefits of inclusion for students with disabilities include a sense of belonging and developing academic and social skills. The benefits of inclusion for students without disabilities include learning compassion, learning how to collaborate in creative ways, and learning to not undermine the abiltiies of people with disabilities. In short, inclusion benefits everyone and if all classrooms were inclusive it would have a profound impact on our future society.</p>
 
  <h2>Resilience (Module 4)</h2>
     <h3>Artifact: <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/ww_bolstering_students.pdf">Bolstering Resilience in Students: Teachers as Protective Factors</a> by Kingsley Hurlington</h3>
     <p>On March 20, 2019, the education minister of Ontario, Lisa Thompson, claimed that increasing high school class sizes will benefit students by making them more <strong>resilient</strong>. This was a highly controversial statement that received backlash from the media. Many people pointed out that resilience doesn't work that way and they voiced their concerns about the dangers of this misbelief. </p>
     <p>According to the monograph <i>Bolstering Resilience in Students: Teachers as Protective Factors</i> by Kingsley Hurlington, resilience is "the capacity to return to good mental health after challenging and difficult situations." "[It] allows individuals to manage difficult episodes or chronic challenges in their lives."" The monograph discusses the research behind how children actually develop resilience. For example, "all children have the capacity to adapt to the challenges of life when they have the <strong>support</strong> they need."" <i>Support</i> is the key word here – we can't just put children in stressful situations and expect them to grow stronger from them all by themselves. So, what does support look like? According to Hurlington, "supportive environments feature caring relationships, high expectations, and opportunities for meaningful participation". Furthermore, "changing the life trajectories of children and youth from risk to resilience starts with changing the beliefs of the adults in their families, schools and community. In other words, developing resilience can't be done alone.</p>
     <p>This is important information for teachers to be aware of. Resilience is a life skill that is crucial to having a happy, successful life. If we want children to learn to be resilient, we need to support them by making our classrooms inclusive learning environments. You can't teach a child to swim by throwing them in the deep end without any life-saving equipment – they first need to get comfortable swimming in the shallow end, which might initially involve needing to wear water wings. Similarly, you can't teach a child to become resilient by taking away their supports and making it harder for them to communicate with their teachers.</p>
     <p>My biggest takeaway from this monograph was that any child can learn to become resilient, even if they grew up in challenging environment, but it can't be done unless they have at least one supportive adult, such as a caring teacher, in their life.</p>
    
  <h2>Growth Mindset (Module 5)</h2>
    <h3>Artifact: Carol Dweck - The Effect of Praise on Mindsets</h3>
    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTXrV0_3UjY"> </iframe>
    <p>If you're in the education industry, it's highly likely that you've heard the term "growth mindset". During my Bachelor of Education program, my professors said "growth mindset" so often that some of my classmates and I started guessing before each lecture how many times they would say it. It was usually between 3 and 16 times per lecture.</p>
    <p>Carol Dweck is the psychologist who coined the term "growth mindset". In 2006, she wrote the first edition of her book <i>Mindset: The new psychology of success</i>, which contained her research about the impact of believing that intelligence is malleable. The video <i>The Effect of Praise on Mindsets</i> is a nice summary of one of her experiments she discussed in her book.</p>
    <p>The video summarizes an experiment in which children are provided with puzzles. The children start off with simple puzzles and when they succeed they are either told that they are "smart at puzzles" or "work hard at puzzles". When they are given more challenging puzzles, the children who were told they were smart were reluctant to do them, whereas the children who were told they worked hard were more eager to do challenging puzzles. The children who were told they were smart wanted affirmation that they were smart so they didn't want to try challenging puzzles that might cause them to struggle, whereas the children who were told they worked hard wanted to learn more and challenge themselves, even if it involved making mistakes. In short, the students who were told they worked hard learned more from the activity and enjoyed it more than the students who were told they were smart.</p>
    <p>Depending on who you ask, the idea of a growth mindset is either profound or obvious. I'm on the "profound" side, the main reason being that many of us grew up believing that it's a kind gesture to call other people "smart" and "intelligence" and it's not obvious why this does not actually not support their growth until you hear or read about Dr. Dweck's research. Short videos such as this can immediately shed some light on lifelong misconceptions. For a teacher, it can have a major impact on their teaching and assessment practices.</p>
