  <h2>Whata GSA Is </h2>
     <p> The initialism "GSA" can stand for a few different things, including Gender-Sexuality Awareness, Gender-Sexuality Acceptance, and Gay-Straight Alliance. A GSA is a school club used to support and promote the LGBTQ+ community. GSAs are typicallly run by students, with supporting staff, and are open to all students in the school. They have gained popularity in recent years and have recieved recognition in national newspapers. </p>

  <h2>GSA Backlash</h2>
     <p> GSAs have unfortunately recieved some backlash, especially from schools in Catholic boards. However, <a href="https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-40/session-1/bill-14">Ontario's Anti-Bullying Act</a> from 2012 states that all publicly-funded schools cannot prohibit students from forming GSAs. It is important to encourage students to form a GSA if one doesn't exist already because they can make a tremendous impact on the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ students at the school. </p>
 
  <h2>Why Every School Should Have a GSA</h2>
     <p> GSAs provide safe spaces for all students, especially LGBTQ+ students. </p>
     <ul> 
        <li> Approximately 1 in 10 people are LGBTQ+. In every school, there will undoubtedly be LGBTQ+ students. </li>  
        <li> According to <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/climate.html">School Climate Surveys</a> conducted in Ontario, a staggering number of LGBTQ+ students are discriminated by students and staff.</li> 
        <li> LGBTQ+ students are more at risk of serious mental health issues, including suicidal ideation, than straight, cisgender students. </li> 
        <li> LGBTQ+ students often have difficulty finding supportive peers, and GSAs would make that easy for them since they would be composed of allies of all sexualities and genders. </li> 
     </ul> 
     <p> GSAs promote awareness about sexulity, gender identity, and gender expression. </p>
     <ul> 
        <li> These are important concepts that are not covered in the currently used Health and Physical Education curricula in Ontario. Not every teacher will take the time to teach beyond the curricula, so it important that these concepts are taught by other means. </li>  
        <li> Students not understanding or being misinformed about these concepts cause them to mistreat LGBTQ+ students. </li>
        <li> Students understanding these concepts allow them to respect and appreciate LGBTQ+ students. </li>
     </ul> 
     <p> GSAs run wellbeing events such as pride events, mental health events, and anti-bullying events. </p>
     <ul> 
        <li> Pride events, such as school-wide pride parades, show how much the school staff care about their LGBTQ+ students. They are important reminders that all students belong at the school. </li>  
        <li> Mental health events remind students and staff the importance of mental health and provide resources for improving mental and physical wellbeing.</li>
        <li> Anti-bullying events remind students and staff that bullying is a serious issue and provide resources for combatting bullying. </li>
     </ul> 
 
  <h2>How to Start a GSA</h2>   
     <p> Just like starting any school club, in order to start a GSA you need a few members and at least one supporting staff member. Once you and a few other students have decided that you want to start a GSA, ask staff members whether any of them are interested in guiding them. The staff member(s) will then register the club and you may begin to further promote the club, hold meets, and plan events. </p>
