    <h2>What are the best placement options?</h2>
  
    <p>There is no single best placement option for a child with special needs. In general, if a child with special needs is comfortable being in a regular classroom, they are encouraged to be placed in a regular classroom. Of course, this is easier said than done. In order for a child with special needs to thrive in a regular classroom, the teacher needs to be equipped with many resources. The teacher should use universal design and differentiation to make the classroom inclusive to the child and to foster their social and intellectual growth.</p>
