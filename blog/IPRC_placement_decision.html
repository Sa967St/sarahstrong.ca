    <h2>What are the best placement options?</h2>
  
    <p>There is no single best placement option for a child with special needs. In general, if a child with special needs is comfortable being in a regular classroom, they are encouraged to be placed in a regular classroom. Of course, this is easier said than done. In order for a child with special needs to thrive in a regular classroom, the teacher needs to be equipped with many resources. The teacher should use universal design and differentiation to make the classroom inclusive to the child and to foster their social and intellectual growth. They should be knowledgeable about the child's IEP and be mindful of their needs when designing lessons and assessments. They should make the child feel like they are welcome in the classroom and they belong learning alongside their classmates who may or may not have special needs.</p>
 
    <p>An example of incorpotating universal design in a regular classroom is for the teacher to design discovery-based inquiry activities instead of lecturing and assigning note-copying. Inquiry activities allow for a deeper understanding of the content and adding a discovery-based twist allows students to work at their own pace and have a sense of achievenent when they finish the activity. This is a great way for all students, especially students with special needs, to enjoy learning and develop their learning skills. </p>

    <p>There are many schools with excellent special education programs, but that doesn't mean that a special education classroom is the best choice for all children with special needs. Some children may thrive in special education classrooms, while some thrive in regular classrooms when they are properly supported and monitored. </p>
