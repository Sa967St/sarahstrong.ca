<h3>Summary of <b>Language is learned through an innate cognitive process</b></h3>

<p> This is one of the three theories about language acquisition. Here is my summary of key parts of the theory, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li> Children learn languages because it is in their nature to do so. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Children begin learning language from the day they are born, and possibly earlier. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Children appear to seek patterns subconsciously, to test the validity of the patterns by reproducing them, and to modify their patterns in response to feedback (this process is called hypothesis testing, which is fundamental to learning the grammatical patterns of a language). </li>
  </br>
  <li> Language is acquired with little or no overt teaching and no careful sequencing or input (e.g. exposure to regular verbs before irregular ones), and when parents intervene to correct their children's speech, the effect is usually minimal. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Language is acquired in a predictable order, which is why instructions and grammar corrections have a minimal effect. </li>
  </br>
  <li> The order of acquisition suggests that language learning is associated with the maturation of the brain. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Overgeneralization is a feature of learning a second language development (e.g. saying "he go" instead of "he goes" because "go" is a more commonly used word and some languages do not conjugate verbs differently for the third person). </li>
  </br>
  <li> These overgeneralized forms are called interlanguage. When interlanguage remains static, it is called fossilization. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Fossilization can happen for these reasons: there is a critical period for language acquisition (the innate ability dimities after puberty), second language learners require explicit instruction, some students need training to become active listeners and observers, and some students may not need or wish to sound like native speakers. </li>
</ul> 

<p> I chose this journal entry because the theory made me think a lot about how important everyone's first language is to them. I also realized how important it is to be selective when correcting ELLs' language mistakes.</p>

<p> This information is important when working with ELLs because it suggests that overcorrecting ELLs' speech and grammar impedes their learning, in the same way that correcting children's speech and grammar in their first language has a minimal effect.</p>
