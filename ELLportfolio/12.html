<h3>Response to "Why K-12 Teachers Need to Know about ESL Grammar Issues."</h3>

<p> The following questions were some of the questions posed as a part of a reflection activity about <a href="https://www.tesol.org/read-and-publish/journals/other-serial-publications/compleat-links/compleat-links-volume-6-issue-3-4-(october-2009)/why-k-12-teachers-need-to-know-about-esl-grammar-issues">Why K-12 Teachers Need to Know about ESL Grammar Issues</a>. Here are my responses to the questions, which is a part of a journal entry. </p>

</br>
<i>According to Folse, how does ESL grammar differ from what is typically taught in the Kâ€“12 classroom?</i>
<p>ELLs tend to make grammar mistakes that native English speakers can easily recognize as incorrect due to them "sounding wrong". They tend to use grammar in ways that differ from native English speakers. </p>

<i>How might the age of your ELL impact your evaluation of the arguments made in this article?</i>
<p>The author, Folse, suggests correcting ELLs with proper explanations using grammatical terminology. I believe that this would be practical only with older ELLs who are already familiar with this terminology and have been using it themselves to help their learning. However, I agree that giving poor feedback (e.g. "it's just an exception" or "it sounds wrong") is insufficent for ELLs of all ages.</p>

<i>Consider some of the common problem areas. Would you be able to provide an explanation for why these structures are incorrect? Is this necessary?</i>
<p>Having studied many languages myself, I was familiar with all of the grammatical terminology mentioned in the article and was able to explain all of the errors in the example sentences. However, it did take me some time to write down polished sentences that explain the errors in each sentence. </p>
</br>


<p> I chose this journal entry because the content of the article captured my attention as a language enthusiast. </p>

<p> This information is important because it gives practical information about helping ELLs understand language conventions. </p>
