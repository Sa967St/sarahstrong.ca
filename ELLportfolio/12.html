<h3>Response to "Why K-12 Teachers Need to Know about ESL Grammar Issues"</h3>

<p> The following questions were some of the questions posed as a part of a reflection activity about <a href="https://www.tesol.org/read-and-publish/journals/other-serial-publications/compleat-links/compleat-links-volume-6-issue-3-4-(october-2009)/why-k-12-teachers-need-to-know-about-esl-grammar-issues">Why K-12 Teachers Need to Know about ESL Grammar Issues</a>. Here are my responses to the questions, which is a part of a journal entry. </p>

</br>
<i>According to Folse, how does ESL grammar differ from what is typically taught in the Kâ€“12 classroom?</i>
<p>ELLs tend to make grammar mistakes that native English speakers can easily recognize as incorrect due to them "sounding wrong". They tend to use grammar in ways that differ from how native English speakers use grammar. </p>

</br>
<i>How might the age of your ELL impact your evaluation of the arguments made in this article?</i>
<p>The author, Folse, suggests correcting ELLs by providing them with proper explanations using grammatical terminology. I believe that this would be practical only with older ELLs who are already familiar with this terminology and have been using it themselves to help their learning. However, I agree that giving poor feedback (e.g. "it's just an exception" or "it sounds wrong") is insufficient for ELLs of all ages. When it is not appropriate to giving descriptive feedback using grammatical terminology, the next best option would be to fully correct the errors rather than merely stating that what the ELL wrote is wrong.</p>

</br>
<i>Consider some of the common problem areas. Would you be able to provide an explanation for why these structures are incorrect? </i>
<p>Having studied many languages myself, I was familiar with all of the grammatical terminology mentioned in the article and was able to explain all of the errors in the example sentences. However, it did take me some time to write down polished sentences that explained each of the errors. I also doubted some of my explanations and wondered whether there were any exceptions. I found this to be challenging since I didn't learn English by memorizing rules; I simply learned how to tell when something sounds right or wrong. </p>
</br>


<p> I chose this journal entry because the content of the article captured my attention as a language enthusiast. I first recognized how little I learned about English grammar during elementary and high school while I was studying Latin in university. I learned a lot about formal English grammar by studying Latin and this helped me become a better writer and speaker. I fully understand how formal grammar instructions can help ELLs improve their English. </p>

<p> This information is important because it gives practical information about helping ELLs understand language conventions. Even if a teacher is not personally interested in learning grammar more formally, the article can help them since it provides some insight on how to avoid giving poor feedback when correcting ELLs' grammar errors. Reading this article might also help entice teachers to take an interest in learning more about grammar. </p>
