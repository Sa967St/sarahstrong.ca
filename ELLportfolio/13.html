<h3>Summary of "Culturally Responsive Pedagogy"</h3>

<p> The monograph <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/CBS_ResponsivePedagogy.pdf">Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</a> emphasizes the importance of teachers being culturally responsive in their teaching practices. Here is my summary of the monograpy, which is a part of a journal entry. </p>

</br>
<ul> 
  <li>Equity is a condition or state of fair, inclusive and respectful treatment of all people. </li>
  </br>
  <li>Inclusive Education is education based on the principles of acceptance and inclusion of all students. </li>
  </br>
  <li>In order to ensure that all students feel safe, welcomed and accepted, and inspired to succeed in a culture of high expectations for learning, schools and classrooms must be responsive to culture. </li>
  </br>
  <li><i>Culturally Relevant Teaching</i> integrates a student’s background knowledge and prior home and community experiences into the curriculum and the teaching and learning experiences that take place in the classroom. This involves… 
    <ul>
      <li>holding high expectations for all students</li>
      </br>
      <li>assisting students in the development of cultural competence</li>
      </br>
      <li>guiding students to develop a critical cultural consciousness</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Culturally Responsive Teaching</i> or <i>Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</i> recognizes that all students learn differently and that these differences may be connected to background, language, family structure and social or cultural identity. The following are its three dimensions.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Institutional</b>: the administration and leadership of school systems, including the values developed and reflected in school board policies and practices. </li>
      </br>
      <li><b>Personal</b>: the mindset of culturally responsive educators and the practices they engage in, in order to support the development of all students. </li>
      </br>
      <li><b>Instructional</b>: knowing learners well and considering the classroom practices which lead to a culturally responsive classroom. </li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Culturally responsive educators have the following characteristics:</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Socio-cultural consciousness</b>:  being aware of how socio-cultural structures impact individual experiences and opportunities. </li>
      </br>
      <li><b>High expectations</b>: holding positive and affirming views of all students of all backgrounds. </li>
      </br>
      <li><b>Desire to make a difference</b>: seeing themselves as change agents working towards more equity. </li>
      </br>
      <li><b>Constructivist approach</b>: understanding that learners construct their own knowledge. </li>
      </br>
      <li><b>Deep knowledge of their students</b>: knowing about the lives of students and their families; know how students learn best and where they are in their learning. </li>
      </br>
      <li><b>Culturally responsive teaching practices</b>: designing and build instruction on students’ prior knowledge in order to stretch students in their thinking and learning.</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
