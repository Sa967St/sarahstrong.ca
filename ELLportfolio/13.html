<h3>Summary of "Culturally Responsive Pedagogy"</h3>

<p>The monograph <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/CBS_ResponsivePedagogy.pdf">Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</a> emphasizes the importance of teachers being culturally responsive in their teaching practices. Here is my summary of the monograph, which is a part of a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li>Equity is a condition or state of fair, inclusive and respectful treatment of all people. </li>
  </br>
  <li>Inclusive Education is education based on the principles of acceptance and inclusion of all students. </li>
  </br>
  <li>In order to ensure that all students feel safe, welcomed and accepted, and inspired to succeed in a culture of high expectations for learning, schools and classrooms must be responsive to culture. </li>
  </br>
  <li><i>Culturally Relevant Teaching</i> integrates a student’s background knowledge and prior home and community experiences into the curriculum and the teaching and learning experiences that take place in the classroom. This involves the following:
    <ul>
      <li>holding high expectations for all students</li>
      <li>assisting students in the development of cultural competence</li>
      <li>guiding students to develop a critical cultural consciousness</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Culturally Responsive Teaching</i> or <i>Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</i> recognizes that all students learn differently and that these differences may be connected to background, language, family structure and social or cultural identity. The following are its three dimensions:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Institutional</b>: the administration and leadership of school systems, including the values developed and reflected in school board policies and practices. </li>
      <li><b>Personal</b>: the mindset of culturally responsive educators and the practices they engage in, in order to support the development of all students. </li>
      <li><b>Instructional</b>: knowing learners well and considering the classroom practices which lead to a culturally responsive classroom. </li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Culturally responsive educators have the following characteristics:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Socio-cultural consciousness</b>: being aware of how socio-cultural structures impact individual experiences and opportunities. </li>
      <li><b>High expectations</b>: holding positive and affirming views of all students of all backgrounds. </li>
      <li><b>Desire to make a difference</b>: seeing themselves as change agents working towards more equity. </li>
      <li><b>Constructivist approach</b>: understanding that learners construct their own knowledge. </li>
      <li><b>Deep knowledge of their students</b>: knowing about the lives of students and their families; know how students learn best and where they are in their learning. 
      <li><b>Culturally responsive teaching practices</b>: designing and build instruction on students’ prior knowledge in order to stretch students in their thinking and learning.</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</br>

<p> I chose this journal entry because I found it interesting that there are so many ways to incorporate students' various cultural backgrounds when teaching. Doing so can make a big difference in how ELL students feel in your classroom and how much they learn. </p>

<p> This information is important when working with ELLs because understanding how to respond to cultural differences in students requires more than a typical understanding of ethnicity, race, and faith. The monograph goes in detail about how to be culturally responsive, which should result in all students feeling safe, welcomed and accepted, and inspired to succeed in a culture of high expectations. </p>
