<h3>Summary of "How to Activate Prior Knowledge for English Learners"</h3>

<p> "How to Activate Prior Knowledge for English Learners" (link not available) is a chapter from <i>Explicit Direct Instruction for English Learners</i> by John R. Hollingsworth. Here are my notes from the article, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li>Explicitly tell students that what they're learning is related to something they already know (they may not recognize the connection otherwise). </li>
  </br>
  <li>Don't use new vocabulary when activating prior knowledge.</li>
  </br>
  <li>When students don't have this prior knowledge, quickly provide some.</li>
  </br>
  <li>Subskill Review is a method to activate prior knowledge.
    <ul>
      <li>It involves reteaching, not quizzing</li>
      </br>
      <li>You identify specific information pertinent to the new lesson and quickly re-teach it.</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Universal Experience is another method to activate prior knowledge.
    <ul>
      <li>You reveals something from students' daily lives (not academic content) that is useful for learning the new content.</li>
      </br>
      <li>You facilitate a short discussion of something your students have experiences in their own lives that reveals that they already know something about the new content</li>
      </br>
      <li> Don't ask about what they know about an academic vocabulary word, ask about what they know about the meaning of that word</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Activating the prior knowledge should take ~5 minutes so the rest of the lesson can be spent on new learning.</li>
</ul>


<p>I chose this journal entry because activating prior knowledge is important when learning new content, but I often spend too much time, sometimes up to half of a lesson, on it. This reading reminded me that activating prior knowledge should be quick so that the rest of the lesson can be spent on new learning.</p>

<p>The information I summarized is important when working with ELLs because it is beneficial for them to make connections to what they already know when learning new content. Not only will they learn the new content more easily if then understand its connection to what they already know, they will also understand why they are learning about it.</p>
