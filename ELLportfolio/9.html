<h3>Notes from "Developing Subject-Specific Vocabulary"</h3>

<p>The article <a href="http://www.edugains.ca/resourcesLIT/AdolescentLiteracy/AL_Resources/VocabularyALERT_8X11.pdf">Developing Subject-Specific Vocabulary</a> provides information about and tips for teaching subject-specific vocabulary to students. Here are my notes from the article, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li>By the time students complete Grade 9, they will have likely encountered approximately 88,500 words. </li>
  </br>
  <li>Students benefit when teachers provide a variety of learning opportunities to learn subject-specific vocabulary. </li>
  </br>
  <li>Students learn more words when they focus on fewer words and use those words in their own speech.</li>
  </br>
  <li>When students receive explicit teaching and guided vocabulary building opportunities, they will:
    <ul>
      <li>develop more sophisticated writing.</li>
      </br>
      <li>use key vocabulary in classroom talk.</li>
      </br>
      <li>choose strategies to reduce gaps in vocabulary understanding.</li>
      </br>
      <li>become aware of and reflect on their own learning.</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </br>
  <li> Effective explicit vocabulary instruction includes: 
    <ul>
      <li>using descriptions as opposed to definitions.</li>
      </br>
      <li>using linguistic and non-linguistic representations to build conceptual understanding.</li>
      </br>
      <li>teaching and using word parts.</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> I chose this journal entry because I've been taught mathematics vocabulary using mostly defifnitions and am now aware that there are more engaging and effective ways to learn subject-specific vocabulary. This article gave me some great ideas for how to help students learn to use these words. </p>

<p> The information I summarized is important when working with ELLs because being able to recite the definition of a word does not mean the student understands what it means or how to use it. There are plenty of strategies to help students acquire vocabulary </p>
