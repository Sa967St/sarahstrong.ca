<h3>About This Portfolio</h3>

<p>I completed this portfolio as a project for the online course <a href="https://coursesforteachers.ca/courses/CONT539">Teaching English Language Learners, Part 1</a>. I spent a lot of time carefully reading articles, documents, and discussion posts from my fellow candiates and took notes on everything along the way. As a result, I gained a lot of insight on what to do when I have ELLs in my class.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the very beginning of the course, I came up with "want to know" questions. I'll be going through each of them and state what I've learn now that the course has finished.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. How can you make your classroom feel welcoming to ELLs, other than putting up welcoming posters and showing students you care about them?</li>
  <li>2. What can be done to make it easier for ELLs to learn the subject matter if they haven't mastered English?</li>
  <li>3. To what degree should you allow ELLs to use their first language in the classroom?</li>
  <li>4. What can you do to help motivate ELLs to try their best to learn English?</li>
  <li>5. What practical options are there for ELLs who fall behind in their classes due to language barriers?</li>
  <li>6. How can you make your classroom feel welcoming to ELLs, other than putting up welcoming posters and showing students you care about them?</li>
</ul>
