<h3>About This Portfolio</h3>

<p>I completed this portfolio as a project for the online course <a href="https://coursesforteachers.ca/courses/CONT539">Teaching English Language Learners, Part 1</a>. I spent a lot of time carefully reading articles, documents, and discussion posts from my fellow candiates and took notes on everything along the way. As a result, I gained a lot of insight on what to do when I have ELLs in my class.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the course, I made the following claims about langage learning. As far as I know, none of them contradicted what I learned from the course. </p>

<ul>
  <li> ELLs can include:
    <ul>
      <li>Aboriginal students whose first language is not English</li>
      <li>students from immigrant countries in which English is not primarily spoken
	â€¢	students whose parents immigrated to Canada and maintained their language and culture within their household and/or community</li>
      <li>students who learned to speak a different dialect of English, particularly dialects that are different in both vocabulary and sentence structure from standard English</li>
      <li>students whose only language is English, but cannot communicate proficiently (e.g. due to learning disabilities)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Language is best learned when the learners feels safe. That means classrooms need to be inclusive and respectful in order for ELLs to reach their potential. This is also true for learning in general.</li>
  <li>It is a misconception that ELLs continuing to learn other language will hinder their ability to learn English.</li>
  <li>BICS (basic interpersonal communication skills) and CALP (cognitive academic language proficiency) are used to describe and measure ELLs' English abilities.</li>
  <li>Every classroom teacher is also a language teacher. They teach students their subject area using language. They also model how to communicate effectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also at the very beginning of the course, I came up with "want to know" questions. I'll be going through each of them and state what I've learned now that the course has finished.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How can you make your classroom feel welcoming to ELLs, other than putting up welcoming posters and showing students you care about them?</li>
  <li>What can be done to make it easier for ELLs to learn the subject matter if they haven't mastered English?</li>
  <li>To what degree should you allow ELLs to use their first language in the classroom?</li>
  <li>What can you do to help motivate ELLs to try their best to learn English?</li>
  <li>What practical options are there for ELLs who fall behind in their classes due to language barriers?</li>
  <li>How can you make your classroom feel welcoming to ELLs, other than putting up welcoming posters and showing students you care about them?</li>
</ol>
