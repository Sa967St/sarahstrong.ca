<h3>About This Portfolio</h3>

<p>I completed this portfolio as a project for the online course <a href="https://coursesforteachers.ca/courses/CONT539">Teaching English Language Learners, Part 1</a>. I spent a lot of time carefully reading articles, documents, and discussion posts from my fellow candiates and took notes on everything along the way. As a result, I gained a lot of insight on what to do when I have ELLs in my classroom. Making seemingly small accommodations and showing an understanding for their situation can help ELLs tremendously with both their learning and their confidence.</p>

<p>My personal teaching philosophy regarding working with ELLs is that teachers should first and formost be aware of any ELLs in their class, what each of their levels of proficiency are in the four language categories (reading, writing, listening, and speaking), determine what their needs are (not just their learning needs), and determine how to meet these needs in the classroom. Teachers should be willing to make many accommodations for ELL and conduct research on the "do's" and "don'ts" of teaching ELLs. There are many misconceptions about teaching ELLs (e.g. using their L1 will hinder their ability to learn English, their English grammar should always be fully corrected, and they should learn to speak without an accent), and simply being aware of these can come a long way. </p>

<p>At the very beginning of the course, I made the following claims about langage learning. As far as I know, none of them contradict any of the material from the course. </p>

<ul>
  <li> ELLs can include:
    <ul>
      <li>Aboriginal students whose first language is not English</li>
      <li>students from immigrant countries in which English is not primarily spoken</li>
      <li>students whose parents immigrated to Canada and maintained their language and culture within their household and/or community</li>
      <li>students who learned to speak a different dialect of English, particularly dialects that are different in both vocabulary and sentence structure from standard English</li>
      <li>students whose only language is English, but cannot communicate proficiently (e.g. due to learning disabilities)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Language is best learned when the learners feels safe. That means classrooms need to be inclusive and respectful in order for ELLs to reach their potential. This is also true for learning in general.</li>
  <li>It is a misconception that ELLs continuing to learn other language will hinder their ability to learn English.</li>
  <li>BICS (basic interpersonal communication skills) and CALP (cognitive academic language proficiency) are used to describe and measure ELLs' English abilities.</li>
  <li>Every classroom teacher is also a language teacher. They teach students their subject area using language. They also model how to communicate effectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also at the very beginning of the course, I came up with several "want to know" questions. I'll be going through each of them and state what I've learned now that the course has finished.</p>

<ol>
  <li><i>How can you make your classroom feel welcoming to ELLs, other than putting up welcoming posters and showing students you care about them?</i>
      <p>ELLs who are new to the region or country should feel welcome if they recieve a thorough orientation prior to starting school so that they understand the differences between their new school system and their old one. All ELLs should also feel welcomed if their culture and background are valued by their teachers and peers. They can be given opporunities to share this information about them. Teachers can also integrate this information into lesson plans and practice cultural responsiveness.</p></li>
  <li><i>What can be done to make it easier for ELLs to learn the subject matter if they haven't mastered English?</i>
      <p>It can be extremely helpful to ELLs when key vocabulary for a course or unit are pre-taught. You can also teach word parts (i.e. affixes and roots) so they can remember words more easily. Simplifying language and using visuals can also help ELLs learn the content more easily.</p></li>
  <li><i>To what degree should you allow ELLs to use their first language in the classroom?</i>
      <p>Having ELLs use their L1 in the classroom can help them learn content in more depth. For example, they can learn more about a topic if they write their personal notes in their L1. They can also translate key vocabulary and other terminology into their L1 and keep a journal or personal dictionary of these words. Since L1 development influences L2 development, ELLs should not be discouraged from occasionally using their L1 in the classroom.</p></li>
  <li><i>What can you do to help motivate ELLs to try their best to learn English?</i>
      <p>It's important to recognize that ELLs often have a disadvantage when it comes to communicating their knowledge and understanding. Just because they can't explain something in English doesn't mean they don't "get it". You can help motivate ELLs to learn English by acknowledging that they have great ideas and that improving their English skills would allow them to share them in more detail.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the middle of the course, I decided on what my vision for ELLs in my classes would be. Here it is. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Make ELLs feel welcomed and comfortable at school.</li>
  <li>Make ELLs feel that their cultural and linguistically background is valued.</li>
  <li>Help reduce challenges ELLs face in the classroom due to language barriers.</li>
  <li>Make ELLs feel capable of learning and accomplishing things.</li>
  <li>Provide ELLs with learning opportunities that are meaningful and allow for the development of higher-order thinking skills.</li>
</ul>
