<h3>Notes from "Language Objectives: The Key to Effective Content Area Instruction for English Learners"</h3>

<p> In the article <a href="http://www.colorincolorado.org/article/language-objectives-key-effective-content-area-instruction-english-learners">Language Objectives: The Key to Effective Content Area Instruction for English Learners</a>, a teacher writes implementing Language Objectives in lessons to benefit ELLs. Here are my notes from the video, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li>Implementing language objectives can be a powerful first step in ensuring that English learners have equal access to the curriculum because the second language acquisition process requires opportunities for the language learner to be exposed to, practice with, and then be assessed on their language skills. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Language objectives involve the four language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing), but they can also include:
    <ul>
      <li> The language functions related to the topic of the lesson (e.g., justify, hypothesize). </li>
      <li> Vocabulary essential to a student being able to fully participate in the lesson (e.g., axis, locate, graph. </li>
      <li> Language learning strategies to aid in comprehension (e.g, questioning, making predictions). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </br>
  <li> English language proficiency or development standards help to identify: 
    <ul>
      <li> Communicative tasks (e.g., retelling, asking clarification questions). </li>
      <li> Language structures (e.g., sequential language, past-conditional tense). </li>
      <li> Types of texts students need to understand (e.g., informational text versus literature). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Teachers can ensure that their language objectives are measureable and student-friendly is by using appropriate verbs, such as: list, retell, summarize in writing, record, read, describe, orally explain, report findings in writing. </li>
  <li> Teachers should have one language objective that is appropriate for all students to meet, rather than differentiate them. </li>
</ul>


<p> I chose this journal entry because when I plan a lesson, I almost always include a learning objective about the content they'll be learning about and start off the lesson by discussing it, but I have never created a language objective before. I was intrigued by the concept and learned a lot of great ideas from the article. </p>

<p> The information I summarized is important when working with ELLs because having a clear language goal can provide them with guidance on what they should accomplish each class. By knowing not only their content-related learning objective, but also their langauge objective, they can ensure that they leave each class having improved both theri content knowledge and their language skills with regard to that content knowledge. </p>
