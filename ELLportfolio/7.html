<h3>Notes from "The Importance of Oral Language Development in the ESL/ELL Classroom"</h3>

<p> In the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cL7Cbk5Lss">The Importance of Oral Language Development in the ESL/ELL Classroom</a>, a teacher discusses the importance of giving ELLs plenty of opportunities to talk. Here are my notes from the video, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li> Research shows us that teachers do the majority of the talking in the talking in the classroom – we know that that doesn't help ELLs. </li>
  </br>
  <li> ELLs must take responsibility for their language learning – but teachers have to provide time for those opportunities. </li>
  </br>  
  <li> ELLS need meaningful opportunities to practice the language, including one-on-one practice with other students. </li>
  </br>  
  <li> Teachers should increase student talk in the classroom – if students have time to practice specific language structures and still have room for creativity, they will remain engaged. </li>
  </br>
  <li> ELLS need multiple opportunities to use language and to express themselves. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Oral foundation helps form the foundation of literacy – explicit oral language instruction serves as a means to develop high levels of academic language proficiency and written discourse. </li>
  </br>
</ul>

<p> I chose this journal entry because a lot of my personal langauge studies were done in silence, and as a result, my speaking skills in the languages I am learning are far weaker than my reading and writing skills in those languages. I can understand why it is important for all students, especially ELLs, to be given plenty of opportunities to talk with each other so they can continue to develop their oral language skills. </p>

<p> The information I summarized is important when working with ELLs because it's easy for teachers to talk too much and not give enough opportunities for their students to talk. Understanding the importance of giving opportunities to ELLs to practice oral communication can help us to remember to make room during lessons for our students to talk to each other.  </p>
