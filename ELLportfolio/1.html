<h3>Notes from <i>Does Learning Languages Make You Smarter?</i><h3>

<p> The video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW_qpta6zb4">Languages and Learning</a> is an interview with three language educators. They answer many intriguing questions, including "Does Learning Languages Make You Smarter?". Here are my notes from the video. </p>

<ul> 
  <li> One difference between language learning as a child (5 years old or younger) and learning it as an adult is that when you learn a new language as an adult, more parts of the brain are involved. When learning a new language as an adult, your brain makes connections to other things you have already learned. </li>
  <li> As a child learning a new language, he or she is regularly exposed regularly in a rich and varied way, which allows for fluency. The same fluency can be achieved as an adult with the same parameters (which is not as practical due to life responsibilities). </li>
  <li> The brain is not neurologically set to learn just one language. </li>
  <li> Learning multiple languages gives processing (cognitive) benefits, which allows students to have an easier time learning new things. </li>
