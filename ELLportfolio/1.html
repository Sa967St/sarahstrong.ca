<h3>Notes from "Does Learning Languages Make You Smarter?"</h3>

<p> The video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW_qpta6zb4">Languages and Learning</a> is an interview with three language educators. They answer many intriguing questions, including "Does Learning Languages Make You Smarter?". Here are my notes from the video, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li> One difference between language learning as a child (5 years old or younger) and learning it as an adult is that when you learn a new language as an adult, more parts of the brain are involved. When learning a new language as an adult, your brain makes connections to other things you have already learned. </li>
  </br>
  <li> When a child is learning a new language, they are regularly exposed to language in a rich and varied way, which allows for fluency. The same fluency can be achieved as an adult with the same parameters (which is not as practical due to life responsibilities). </li>
  </br>  
  <li> The brain is not neurologically set to learn just one language. </li>
  </br>  
  <li> Learning multiple languages gives processing (cognitive) benefits, which allows students to have an easier time learning new things. </li>
  </br>
</ul>

<p> I chose this journal entry because I learned a lot from the video. I was engaged throughout it and has several "a-hah moments" as I thought about my own language learning experiences. </p>

<p> The information I summarized is important when working with ELLs because they give insight on the process of learning new languages. This information can help educators come up with strategies so that their ELLs can best learn English. </p>
