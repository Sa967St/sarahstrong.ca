<h3>Notes from "Writing to Learn: Capacity Building Series"</h3>

<p>The monograph <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/CBS_WritingtoLearn.pdf">Writing to Learn</a> discusses writing-to-learn texts. Here are my notes from the monograph, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li>Writing-to-learn texts are informal and generally free-flowing as students explore their personal lines of thinking.</li>
  </br>
  <li>In writing-to-learn texts, the audience is typically the writer himself or herself and not other readers.</li>
  </br>
  <li>Students may share their writing-to-learn texts with other students and the teacher for <i>assessment for learning</i> purposes. </li>
  </br>
  <li>Writing-to-learn texts can help answer the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>What are some of the things they know and understand?</li>
      <li>Where are some of the gaps, confusions or misconceptions?</li>
      <li>What are some of the questions they have?</li>
      <li>What are some of the connections they are making between new and prior knowledge?</li>
      <li>What new insights are they developing?</li>
      <li>How aware are they of the learning processes they use and the effectiveness of those processes?</li>
      </br>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Writing-to-learn activities may be used:
    <ul>
      <li>before a learning experience to get students to "warm up" by thinking about what they know or think they know or feel about a new text or topic explored in a previous lesson</li>
      <li>during a learning experience to get students to "check in" by thinking about what they understand, what connections they are making, where they are unsure and what questions they have</li>
      <li>after a learning experience to get students to "take stock", summarizing, synthesizing, evaluating or explaining what they have learned and where they are having difficulty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </br>
  <li>Some Dos and Don’ts for writing to learn:
    <ul>
      <li>Do keep writing!</li>
      <li>Don’t stop! Even if you have run out of things to write about, keep your pencil on the paper or fingers on the keyboard. </li>
      <li>Don’t back up! Don’t waste valuable thinking time by going back to change what you have written. </li>
      <li>Don’t edit. Don’t waste valuable thinking time correcting spelling or grammar. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I chose this journal entry because I found the idea of writing-to-learn texts interesting. I'm so accustomed to traditional writing, which involves writing down a polished version of my ideas with the expectation of submitting it. This monologue provided me with some great ideas for activities I can do with high school math students.</p>

<p>The information I summarized is important when working with ELLs because the editing part of the writing process can be challenging for them, and writing-to-learn doesn't have involve editing. By encouraging ELLs to write down their thoughts word-for-word, like a transcript, they don't have to "waste" time polishing their work. This can teach them that their thoughts and ideas are valuable on their own, regardless of whether they can accurately convey them on paper. </p>
