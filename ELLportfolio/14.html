<h3>Response to "Strategy Inventory for Language Learning"</h3>

<p><a href="https://richarddpetty.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/sill-english.pdf">Strategy Inventory for Language Learning</a> is a survey that assesses language learning strategies based on these six categories: memory, cognitive, compensatory, social, affective, and metacognitive. Here is my response to taking this survey (replacing every instance of "English" with the languages I am currently learning), which is a part of a journal entry. </p>

</br>
<p><i>In which of the six categories did you score the highest? Lowest?</i></p>
<p>My answers varied depending on the language. I'm learning several languages right now and I have different goals for some of them. My goals are to become fluent in speaking Japanese and Esperanto and in reading Italian and French. I scored the highest in <i>cognitive</i> and <i>social</i> for Japanese and Esperanto, and in <i>memory</i> and <i>compensatory</i> for Italian and French. I scored the lowest in <i>affective</i> for all of them.</p>
</br>

<p><i>What were your predominant language learning strategies?</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Connect the sound or spelling of a new word with an image of it.</li>
  <li>Use flashcards to drill word meanings and spellings.</li>
  <li>Memorize common phrases and expressions.</li>
  <li>Watch TV shows in different languages with subtitles in that language.</li>
  <li>Make educated guesses when unfamiliar words are encountered.</li>
  <li>Take notice of mistakes and how to correct them.</li>
  <li>Ask questions about the language to native speaker.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<p><i>Do you think your personal preferences would impact the way you teach ELLs?</i></p>
<p>No, I don't think it would impact the way I teach ELLs since I understand that all students have different learning preferences. I don't exclusively use strategies that work for me – I also use ones that don't work for me but that I know have worked for others.</p>
</br>

<p><i>How could you use different language learning strategies to develop students’ capacity to be independent, autonomous learners or to make informed judgments about the quality of student learning (assessment of learning)?</i></p>
<p>TODO</p>
</br>

<p><i>How might culture and educational background influence strategy use?</i></p>
<p>TODO</p>

<p> I chose this journal entry because I enjoyed taking the quiz and </p>

<p> This information is important when working with ELLs because... </p>
