<h3>Response to "Strategy Inventory for Language Learning"</h3>

<p><a href="https://richarddpetty.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/sill-english.pdf">Strategy Inventory for Language Learning</a> is a survey that assesses language learning strategies based on these six categories: memory, cognitive, compensatory, social, affective, and metacognitive. Here is my response to taking this survey (replacing every instance of "English" with the languages I am currently learning), which is a part of a journal entry. </p>

</br>
<p><i>In which of the six categories did you score the highest? Lowest?</i></p>
<p>My answers varied depending on the language. I'm learning several languages right now and my goals are not the same for all of them. My goals are to become fluent in speaking Japanese and Esperanto and in reading Italian and French. I scored the highest in <i>cognitive</i> and <i>social</i> for Japanese and Esperanto, but <i>memory</i> and <i>compensatory</i> for Italian and French. I scored the lowest in <i>affective</i> for all of them.</p>

<p><i>What were your predominant language learning strategies?</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Connect the sound or spelling of a new word with an image of it.</li>
  <li>Use flashcards to drill word meanings and spellings.</li>
  <li>Memorize common phrases and expressions.</li>
  <li>Watch TV shows in different languages with subtitles in that language.</li>
  <li>Make educated guesses when unfamiliar words are encountered.</li>
  <li>Take notice of mistakes and how to correct them.</li>
  <li>Ask questions about the language to native speaker.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>How could you use different language learning strategies to develop studentsâ€™ capacity to be independent, autonomous learners or to make informed judgments about the quality of student learning?</i></p>
<p>I think it would be useful to give ELLs this survey so that they get exposed to different strategies to try as well as inform me of the strategies that currently work for them. By being knowledgeable about their preferred learning strategies and giving them opportunities to use them, they can learn in the various ways that they prefer. Also by allowing them to use their preferred strategies, I can assess their learning more accurately.</p>

<p><i>How might culture and educational background influence strategy use?</i></p>
<p>Students from various cultural and educational backgrounds may have only been exposed to a small selection of these strategies due to different views on teaching and learning. Also, depending on their cultural and educational background, they may be more or less open to trying new strategies. </p>

</br>

<p>I chose this journal entry because I enjoyed taking the quiz and it exposed me to language learning strategies that I don't use or haven't thought of using. In particular, I hardly every think about the emotional aspect when I'm learning languages. </p>

<p>This information is important when working with ELLs because the it exposes them to new language learning strategies to try. You can also ask ELLs to take the survey themselves so you are informed about the strategies they prefer.</p>
