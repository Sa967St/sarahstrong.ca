<h3>Summary of <i>Language is learned through imitation and habit formation</i></h3>

<p> This is on of the three theories about language acquisition. Here is my summary of key parts of the theory, which is a journal entry. </p>

<ul> 
  <li> Children are born with the physical ability to learn to produce the sounds of any language, which they accomplish through imitation. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Children can also produce words they they have never heard before (e.g. "I brang it") as a result of trying an analogy. </li>
  </br>
  <li> Children are not exposed to enough examples of every possible grammatical pattern to enable them to acquire all patterns as habit. </li>
  </br>
  <li> When children receive positive reinforcement for having communicated something, the reinforcement encourages the children to continue reproducing language patterns until they become language habits. </li>
  </br>
  <li> ELLs learn to pronounce the sounds and words of the new language through imitation as well, however they may have difficulty recognizing and producing some of the same sounds of a new language due to interferences from their first language, resulting in an accent (moving the tongue in unfamiliar ways can be very difficult). </li>
  </br>
  <li> Some of the hardest sounds to learn in English as an ELL are: soft th, hard th, v, w, l, and r. </li>
</ul> 

<p> I chose this journal entry because the theory made me think a lot about how learning a language natively is completely different than learning one later in life. ELLs will have stuggles learning English that native English speakers never had. </p>

<p> This information important when working with ELLs because it can remind you that ELLs learn English in a completely different way than native English speakers do. Native English speakers make lots of mistakes too when they are first learning English, but they had more time and opportunities to recognize and correct their mistakes. </p>
