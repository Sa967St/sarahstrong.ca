<h3> Letter Template for Students New to The Country</h3>

<p> Students who are new to Canada face many challenges that their peers do not. This is a letter template that can be given to high school students who are new to Canada so that they can become more familiar with their new school system. This letter would prefrable be translated in the students' home languages and be given out during the orienttion process. </p>
</br>
<p> Welcome to [school name], [student name]! </p>
<p> This letter is an introduction to our school system. Many countries' school systems look quite different from ours, and we would like to inform you of many of these difference. </p>
<p> [A paragraph about the roles of teachers, guidance counsellors, and principals, including how they support ELLs.] </p>
<p> [A list of classroom expectations (e.g. participation in class discissions and asking for help.)] </p>
<p> [A list of school expectations (e.g. dress code and no bringing common allergens.)] </p>
<p> [A paragraph about disciplinary actions (e.g. detentions, suspensions, and expulsions.)] </p>
<p> [A paragraph about how and where to get support.] </p>
<p> [One page showing a chart with the school schedule and bell times.] </p>
<p> [One page showing extracurricular activities and sports currently available at the school.] </p>
<p> [One page with an overview of course selection and compulsary courses, and a chart of the different streams.] </p>
<p> [One page with a list of emergency procederes and what they look like (e.g. fire drill and lockdown drill.)] </p>
<p> [One page with a map of the school with a clear indication of the most important locations.] <p>
<p> We also send out monthly newsletters with upcoming events and important dates. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to call our school at [phone number] any time from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM on weekdays. </p>
<p> Sincerely, [name of author, position of author] </P>

<p> I chose this journal entry because I have never heard of this information being given all at once in written form. Most students should be familiar with our school system and will only need some of this information, but for students new to the country, you can't be sure what is common sense. I feel that providing this information should be a part of their orientation, in which they visit the school to get a tour and meet some staff members. </p>

<p> This information is important when working with ELLs because many of them will be new to the country. Providing students new to the country with this sort of information up front can significantly reduce many the challenges they face. A lot of this information is common sense to students who have always been in the Canadian school system, so it is often overlooked. Students who attended schools in other countries and are new to Canada will likely experience culture shock in unexpected ways, and informing them ahead of time of what our school system is like can help ease their transition.</p>
