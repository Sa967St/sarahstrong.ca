<h3>Notes from "Adapting the Classroom Program for ELLs"</h3>

<p> The video <a href="http://www.edugains.ca/resourcesELL/WebCasts_WebClips/Video/SupportingELL/07_AdaptingTheClassroomProgramForELLs.mp4">Adapting the Classroom Program for ELLs</a> is an Edugains video covering ways to support the understanding and learning of ELLs.interview with three language educators. Here are my notes from the video, which is a journal entry. </p>

<p> The teacher in the video supports the understanding and learning of her ELLs by ... </p>
<ul> 
  <li> encouraging students to use their home language.
  </br>
  <li> finding out what students' interest are and incorporating them into lessons.
  </br>  
  <li> breaking down learning into manageable chunks.
  </br>  
  <li> pre-teaching new vocabulary associated with a new assignment or topic.
  </br>  
  <li> simplifying vocabulary and using words that are in everyday use.
  </br>  
  <li> having students review main concepts and vocabulary with partners in a Think-Pair-Share task at the end of each activity.
  </br>  
  <li> teaching language structures by highlighting specific structures.
  </br>  
  <li> recycling new words, reintroducing new words in a different context, and using recently learned words to introduce or expand a concept.
  </br>  
  <li> gradually releasing responsibility to support student independence.
  </br>  
</ul>

<p> I chose this journal entry because the video provided a lot of meaningful ways to help ELLs learn. The teacher in the video was truly devoted to doing what she could to help her ELLs, and was successful. </p>

<p> The information I summarized is important when working with ELLs because they allow ELLs to easily perform to the best of their ability and to be confident learners. They are simple strategies that make a big difference. </p>
