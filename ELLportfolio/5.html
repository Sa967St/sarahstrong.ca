<h3>Response to "How will a culture of high expectations benefit your ELLs?"</h3>

<p> This question was posed as a part of a reflection acvitity about the <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/EquityQuickFacts.pdf">Ontario's Equity and Inclusive Education Strategy</a>. Here is my response to the question, which is a journal entry. </p>

<p> TODO </p>

<p> I chose this journal entry because when working with ELLs it may seem like a good idea to give them easier work in hopes of increasing their confidence, but this simply will not work when the ELLs are aware that they were given easier work than their peers. </p>

<p> This information is important because providing simpler tasks to ELLs not only makes them feel less competent and capable than their peers, they also are not getting the opportunity to develop higher-order cognitive skills, which all students deserve. </p>
