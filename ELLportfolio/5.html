<h3>Response to "How will a culture of high expectations benefit your ELLs?"</h3>

<p> This question was posed as a part of a reflection acvitity about the <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/EquityQuickFacts.pdf">Ontario's Equity and Inclusive Education Strategy</a>. Here is my response to the question, which is a journal entry. </p>

</br>
<p> Many ELLs, especially recent immigrants, are at risk of lower achievement. If you have lower expectations for ELLs, they will pick up on this and believe that you don't think they are as capable as their peers. If you give simpler tasks, even if it is done with the hopes of boosting their confidence, it can have the opposite effect if they recognize that you gave them an easier task than their peers. The key to showing you have high expectations of all students is to promote equity and excellence. Promoting equity involves incorporating individual differences in order for all students to reach a common goal. Rather than giving ELLs simpler tasks, you can give them the same task as their peers except with scaffolds that allow them to understand the task and demonstrate their knowledge more easily. Rather than change the task to make it simpler, it can be changed to make it more understandable and easier to respond. This is important to do since ELLs will be able to show what they are capable of and achieve as high as their peers. </p>

<p> I chose this journal entry because when working with ELLs it may seem like a good idea to give them easier work in hopes of increasing their confidence. However, this simply will not work when the ELLs are aware that they were given easier work than their peers. </p>

<p> This information is important because providing simpler tasks to ELLs not only makes them feel less competent and capable than their peers, they also are not getting the opportunity to develop higher-order cognitive skills, which all students deserve. </p>
