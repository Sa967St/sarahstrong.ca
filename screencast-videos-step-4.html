<p>Here are some ways of sharing a video with your students.</p>

<br />

<h3>Upload it to YouTube</h3>
<p>This is probably the easiest way to share videos, as long as everyone has a reliable Internet connection. You can send them the URL directly, or embed the YouTube video on another platform. This is objectively the best way of sharing videos if you want it to reach viewers beyond your classroom.</p>

<br />

<h3>Upload it to Dropbox</h3>
<p>This is a reasonable way to share videos, again as long as everyone has a reliable Internet connection. You can send them the URL directly, and they can watch the video directly in their browser without needing to download it.</p>

<br />

<h3>Upload it to a Learning Management System</h3>
<p>If your class actively uses a Learning Management System (e.g., D2L, Moodle, Edmodo, Google Classroom), this is a reasonable way to share videos. You can upload the file directly, or first upload it to YouTube and embed the YouTube video. They can watch the video directly in the browser.</p>

<br />

<h3>Burn it onto DVDs</h3>
<p>This is a solution for sharing videos with students who do not have a reliable Internet connection. They can watch the videos on a DVD player or on a computer without an Internet connection.</p>
