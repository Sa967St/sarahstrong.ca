    <h2 class="prepend-title">How to Create a Screencast Video</h2>
      <p>Screencasts are digital recordings of computer screens, and can be used to make instructional videos for flipping the classroom.</p>
      <p>You can deliver a lesson by drawing on your screen while speaking into a microphone, and make it into a video.</p>
      <p>This is a recipe for making your own "flipped classroom videos".</p>

        <td>If you are writing or drawing a lot during your lesson, you may want a drawing tablet and digital pen to use instead of a mouse.
        <br><a href="http://bamboo.wacom.com/">Wacom Bamboo</a> is the most well known brand of drawing tablets. The digital pens have motion censors and are used like a mouse.
        <br>There are a variety of different models, and the cheapest ones can cost as little as $50.

        <br> Any cheap USB microphone you can find will probably suffice.
        <br>You may want to avoid using your computer's built-in microphone because it will pick up unwanted sounds such as your computer's fan running.

        <br>If your computer doesn't have a built-in webcam, any cheap one should suffice, unless you are specifically looking for a high quality one.
        <br>Note: If you are using a webcam, you will also need software to save the recordings. You can use a basic video editing program, like Windows Movie Maker.

      <h3>Video Editing Software</h3>
      <p>If you don't intend on doing any post-production editing, except for maybe trimming the video and inserting video clips, all you will need is basic free video editing software.</p>
      <p>All PCs come with Windows Movie Maker installed, and all Macs come with iMovie installed. Either of those should suffice for straightforward editing.</p>
      <p>If you want to be able to do more editing on your videos and you do not have Camtasia Studio, you may want to look into the following paid options.</p>
