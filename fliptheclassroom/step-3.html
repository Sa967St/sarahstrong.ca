<h2>Step 3 - Edit and produce the video</h2>

<p>Here are some things you can do when with video editing software after you finished recording. </p>

<h3>Trimming</h3>
<p>If you don't start the lesson immediately when the screen recording starts or you take a while to turn it off at the end, you may want to trim the beginning and/or end of the video. You can also cut out mistakes and long pauses in the video</p>

<h3>Zooming</h3>
<p>If you captured your entire screen or a large portion of your screen, but only used part of it, you can zoom in to the part of the screen that you used. You can also zoom in and out of parts of the screen to redirect the students' focus.</p>
