<h3>Video Editing Software</h3>

<p>If you don't intent on doing any post-production editing, except for maybe trimming the video and inserting video clips, all you will need is a basic free video editing software.</p>

<p>All PCs come with Windows Movie Maker installed, and all Macs come with iMovie installed, and either of those should suffice for very basic editing.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to do more editing your videos and you do not have Camtasia Studio, you may want to look into the following non-free options.</p>
