    <p>My favourite subject has always been mathematics. I pursued my passion in mathematics by studying Combinatorics at University of Waterloo, obtaining a B. Math. I minored in computer science, learning languages including Python, C, C++, and SQL. I also minored in Classical Studies, studying Latin, Ancient Greek, and classical mythology.</p>
    <p>I am currently finishing the B. Ed. program at Queen's University, in which I will be qualified to teach mathematics and computer studies in the intermediate and senior divisions.</p>
