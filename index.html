    <p>My favourite subject has always been mathematics.</p>
    <p>I pursued my passion in mathematics by studying Combinatorics at University of Waterloo, obtaining a Bachelor of Mathematics.<p>
    <p>I minored in computer science, learning languages including Python, C, C++, and SQL.</p>

    <h2 class="append-title">My Beliefs</h2>
	<p>Here are some of my beliefs about teaching.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> All students deserve to enjoy learning.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> All students deserve to be able to rely on their teachers to take necessary actions to benefit their learning experiences.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> Teachers should build inclusive classrooms where students feel safe to ask questions.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> Teachers should embrace and celebrate the diversity of students, because the idea of there being a "normal" kind of student can have an adverse effect on students in the classroom who feel different than some of their peers.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> The most effective teaching and learning happens when students are actively involved, interested, and engaged in their work.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> Teachers should look for learning, not just correct answers.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> Teachers should determine studentsâ€™ academic needs (e.g., how to study for tests effectively) beyond the curriculum documents, to ensure future success.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> Teachers should teach and assess in a variety of ways to reflect the learning styles of different students, and always keep in mind the many barriers that different students face.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> Teaching styles should to be geared towards making the greatest impacting on <i>every</i> student, not just <i>most</i> students.</li> 
      <br />
      <li> Teachers should promote self-care to students and be lenient and understanding when students feel overwhelmed or are unable to finish their work because of other commitments or issues. Teachers should openly express to students that health and safety are far more important than schoolwork and it is not a poor reflection of themselves when they choose it is best to sacrifice schoolwork and/or studying for other commitments.</li> 
    </ul>
