<p>Welcome to my teaching profile!</p>

<p>This is where you can find out about who I am as an educator.</p>

<p>This site is a work-in-progress, so I apoplogize for some awkward formatting and incomplete pages.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>My favourite subject has always been mathematics. I pursued my passion in mathematics by studying Combinatorics at University of Waterloo, obtaining a B. Math. I minored in computer science, learning languages including Python, C, C++, and SQL. I also minored in Classical Studies, studying Latin, Ancient Greek, and classical mythology. </p>
