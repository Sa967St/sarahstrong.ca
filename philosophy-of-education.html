<h3>My Philosophy of Teaching Mathematics</h3>

<p>I believe that a teacher has a significant impact on whether a student likes a subject, and mathematics, one of the most commonly disliked subjects in high school, is no exception. The most common reasons I have heard about why high school students dislike mathematics are that "it's boring" and "it's too difficult", which are results of how mathematics has been taught to them, rather than the nature of the content. There are interesting and engaging ways to teach any subject matter, regardless of whether the students inherently dislike it. It is up to me as an educator to experiment with giving various learning opportunities for students, then determine which ones they find most enjoyable and effective.</p> 
<p>Much of the insight I have is from my experiences with grade 9 and 10 applied classes during my practica. Many of them did not have a strong foundation in mathematics and needed lessons to be as engaging and fun in order to learn the concepts. I introduced students to various of manipulatives, including 3D Geosolids, foldable nets, and Algebra Tiles, which helped the lessons be more memorable to them. I also incorporated educational technology in various ways. I gave them practice problems using apps like Socrative, which students found a lot more fun than doing worksheets on paper, and was also very effective for assessment as learning. I also had students come up to the Smart Board to show their work to the class, which they found enjoyable since they get to show their learning to the class.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of teaching mathematics is to put an emphasis on students developing their learning skills: responsibility, organization, initiative, independent work, collaboration, and self-regulation. Without these skills, it is very hard for anyone to succeed in learning mathematics. Since mathematics is very content-based, becoming good at it requires practice, critical thinking, and more practice. By putting learning skills first, especially in grade 9 and 10, students can develop the right mindset towards learning, and can recognize can learn anything they want when they put the effort into it.</p>
<p>I find that one of the common reasons that many of my students find mathematics too difficult is that their classes are too fast-paced, and they have trouble keeping up with the curriculum, especially when they are too afraid or just do not bother to ask questions in class. It is up to me as educator to build an inclusive classroom where students feel safe to ask questions, and where they can rely on me to take necessary actions to benefit their learning experiences.
<p>None of this is possible when an educator does not take the time to get to know their students. Another important aspect of teaching is to get to know the students so they feel welcome, accepted, cared for, and safe in your classroom. Unless they feel this way, they cannot prosper as a learner and mature as a human being. I believe it is very important to regularly have one-on-one conversations with every student to casually discuss their learning. There is plenty of time during lessons to sit down next to students to ask them how they are doing and what they think about what they are learning. This is a regular habit of mine that I find helps students tremendously enjoy coming to class more.</p>
<p>I believe that every student has the potential to perform well in mathematics. My philosophy of teaching mathematics is that most effective teaching and learning happens when students are actively involved, interested, and engaged in their work. It is my duty as an educator to determine what makes learning exciting to students and develop lessons around those ideas. All students deserve to enjoy learning.
