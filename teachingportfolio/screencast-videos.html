    <h2 class="prepend-title">How to Create a Screencast Video</h2>
      <p>Screencasts are digital recordings of computer screens, and can be used to make instructional videos for flipping the classroom.</p>
      <p>You can deliver a lesson by drawing on your screen while speaking into a microphone, and make it into a video.</p>
      <p>This is a recipe for making your own "flipped classroom videos".</p>

        <td>If you are writing or drawing a lot during your lesson, you may want a drawing tablet and digital pen to use instead of a mouse.
        <br><a href="http://bamboo.wacom.com/">Wacom Bamboo</a> is the most well known brand of drawing tablets. The digital pens have motion censors and are used like a mouse.
        <br>There are a variety of different models, and the cheapest ones can cost as little as $50.

        <br>You may want to avoid using your computer's built-in microphone because it will pick up unwanted sounds such as your computer's fan running.

        <br>If your computer doesn't have a built-in webcam, any cheap one should suffice, unless you are specifically looking for a high quality one.
        <br>Note: If you are using a webcam, you will also need software to save the recordings. You can use a basic video editing program, like Windows Movie Maker.

      <h3>Video Editing Software</h3>
      <p>If you don't intend on doing any post-production editing, except for maybe trimming the video and inserting video clips, all you will need is basic free video editing software.</p>
      <p>All PCs come with Windows Movie Maker installed, and all Macs come with iMovie installed. Either of those should suffice for straightforward editing.</p>
      <p>If you want to be able to do more editing on your videos and you do not have Camtasia Studio, you may want to look into the following paid options.</p>

      <h2 class="append-title">Record the video</h2>
      <p>After you have all the software and hardware ready to go, here's how you would record the video.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open the drawing software.</li>
        <li>Set up any hardware you're using.
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Plug in the USB cable from the drawing tablet.</li>
            <li>Plug in the USB cable from the microphone.</li>
            <li>Set up and start recording from the webcam.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Start capturing the screen and audio.</li>
        <li>Deliver the lesson.
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Use the pen and tablet to write and draw in the drawing software.</li>
            <li>Speak into the microphone.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stop capturing the screen and audio.</li>
        <li>Turn off the webcam (if applicable).</li>
        <li>Save the files.</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
 
    <div class="step-3 section">
      <h2 class="append-title">Edit and produce the video</h2>
      <p>Here are some things you can do with video editing software after you finished recording. </p>
      
      <br />

      <h3>Trimming</h3>
      <p>If you don't start the lesson immediately when the screen recording starts or you take a while to turn it off at the end, you may want to trim the beginning and/or end of the video. You can also cut out mistakes and long pauses in the video.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Zooming</h3>
      <p>If you captured your entire screen or a large portion of your screen, but only used part of it, you can zoom in to the part of the screen that you used. You can also zoom in and out of parts of the screen to redirect the students' focus.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Adding titles and annotations</h3>
      <p>You can annotate your video by adding text to reinforce parts of the lesson.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Adding images</h3>
      <p>You can add smaller images on top of the recording to reinforce parts of the lesson.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Adding other videos</h3>
      <p>You can add video clips in the middle of the recording to reinforce parts of the lesson. You can use <a href="http://www.youtubedownloaderhd.com/">YouTube Downloader</a> to download videos from YouTube to import into your video editing software.</p>
      <p>If you recorded yourself with a webcam, you can place the webcam recording in a corner of the screen throughout the video.</p>

      </div>
 
    <div class="step-4 section">
      <h2 class="append-title">Publish the video</h2>
      <p>Here are some ways of sharing a video with your students.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Upload it to YouTube</h3>
      <p>This is probably the easiest way to share videos, as long as everyone has a reliable Internet connection. You can send them the URL directly, or embed the YouTube video on another platform. This is objectively the best way of sharing videos if you want it to reach viewers beyond your classroom.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Upload it to Dropbox</h3>
      <p>This is a reasonable way to share videos, again as long as everyone has a reliable Internet connection. You can send them the URL directly, and they can watch the video directly in their browser without needing to download it.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Upload it to a Learning Management System</h3>
      <p>If your class actively uses a Learning Management System (e.g., D2L, Moodle, Edmodo, Google Classroom), this is a reasonable way to share videos. You can upload the file directly, or first upload it to YouTube and embed the YouTube video. They can watch the video directly in the browser.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Burn it onto DVDs</h3>
      <p>This is a solution for sharing videos with students who do not have a reliable Internet connection. They can watch the videos on a DVD player or on a computer without an Internet connection.</p>
