<h3>Desmos</h3>   
<p><a href ="http://Desmos.com">Desmos</a> is an online graphing calculator that I use for all graphing units in math classes. Both the desktop version and the mobile app are very user-friendly and have lots of useful features. One of the most useful features of Desmos is the slider tool, in which students can manipulate coefficients and constants in equations and instantly see how its graph is modified. I let students play around with the sliders to make connections about the geometric significance of the coefficients and constants in equations. There are plenty of class activities that can be done using Desmos, such as finding equations of two sinusoidal functions that are coincident, using trial and error, which is something that could be very time-consuming and frustrating without graphing technology.</p>

<h3>Gizmos</h3>   
<p><a href="https://www.explorelearning.com/">Gizmos<a> are online interactive simulations of math and science concepts. Students can manipulate with equations, graphs, shapes, and data and get immediate results. They are great for topics that involve a lot of visualization, because they can be difficult for students to grasp by just reading about them or looking at images of them. Exploring these simulations is inquiry-based learning, which is an effective way for many students to learn mathematics.</p>

<h3>Kahoot!</h3>   
<p><a href="https://getkahoot.com/">Kahoots</a> are competitive quiz games in which students score points based on how quickly they answer questions correctly. The results of each game, including each students' individual answers, can be downloaded and reviewed by the teacher. I was initially concerned about using Kahoot for reviewing concepts because I figured that it could upset students who were performing weakly in the course. However, when I first tried it and I was surprised at how excited all students became. When the game started, it instantly got very competitive. Students were having fun trying to sabotage each other by calling out incorrect answers, and they celebrated when they passed each others' scores. </p>
<p>It was certainly entertaining, although I felt it didn't help too much as a review session, since many students were just copying answers off their peers or were making quick guesses hoping to luck out and catch up. I was expecting this to be a good opportunity to determine what students were struggling with the most, but based on how they were playing, I took the results with a grain of salt. Furthermore, since many of the students entered nicknames not resembling their real names, I couldn't always tell whose results were whose, so I got only general information on what questions students found easiest.</p>
<p>The most common request students made in all of my practica was: "Can we play Kahoot more often?". I made it a tradition to play Kahoot on my last day of class using trivia questions about the subject. This way, students who did poorly would know that it was not a poor reflection of their abilities, since all students were mostly guessing answers.</p>

<h3>Nearpod</h3>   
<p><a href="https://nearpod.com/">Nearpod</a> is an interactive presentation tool in which students follow along with a presentation on their devices. Teachers can create presentations with slides, videos, images, quizzes, polls, and open questions, and can see students' responses as they are being submitted. I have used it in grade 9 and 10 applied classes to gain a lot of insight about their learning throughout the activities. I think the neatest feature is the ability to share students' responses anonymously. When students submit their responses, I can share a response so that all students can see it on their screens and have discussions about the response. Students get excited when their own responses are being shared.</p>
<p>I find that the most useful part of using Nearpod is the data that is collected throughout a presentation. It is a great assessment as learning tool, since all the students' responses are neatly organized into tables. I can also see which student gave which responses since they were required to enter their real name, which showed up only in the presentation report, and a nickname, which showed up only during the presentation.</p>
<p>I also found that students like answering questions using this kind of software on their iPads a lot more than doing worksheets or writing on the whiteboard. The feature I use the most is "Draw It", in which students draw on their screens with their fingertips. Since it is a teacher-paced presentation (every student is on the same activity at the same time), this keeps the whole class engaged since everyone is on the same short task at a given time.</p>

<h3>Socrative</h3>   
<p><a href="https://socrative.com/">Socrative</a> is a student-paced online quizzing tool. I have used it for assessment as learning by asking questions to students about what they struggled with most, what they understood most, and what they wanted to review most. I get useful information on what the students believed they remember the least and most about, which I use to create review activities for the subsequent lessons.</p>
