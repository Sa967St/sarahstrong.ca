    <h2>How to Create a Screencast Video</h2>

      <p>Screencasts are digital recordings of computer screens, and can be used to make instructional videos for flipping the classroom.</p>
      
      <p>You can deliver a lesson by drawing on your screen while speaking into a microphone, and make it into a video.</p>

      <p>This is a recipe for making your own "flipped classroom videos".</p>

      <h3>Step 1 - <a href="http://sarahstrong.ca/screencast-videos#section/step-1">Acquire software and hardware</a></h3>
      <h3>Step 2 - <a href="http://sarahstrong.ca/screencast-videos#section/step-2">Record the video</a></h3>
      <h3>Step 3 - <a href="http://sarahstrong.ca/screencast-videos#section/step-3">Edit and produce the video</a></32>
      <h3>Step 4 - <a href="http://sarahstrong.ca/screencast-videos#section/step-4">Publish the video</a></h3>

    <h2 class="append-title">Experience with Apps</h2>
      <h3>Desmos</h3>   
      <p><a href ="http://Desmos.com">Desmos</a> is an online graphing calculator that I use for all graphing units in math classes. There is both a desktop version and a mobile app. One of the most useful features of Desmos is the slider tool, in which students can manipulate coefficients and constants in equations and instantly see how its graph changes. I let students play around with the sliders to make connections about the geometric significance of the coefficients and constants in equations. There are plenty of class activities for which Desmos can be used, such as finding equations of two sinusoidal functions that are coincident, using trial and error, which is something that could be very time-consuming and frustrating without graphing technology.</p>

      <br />
      
      <h3>Gizmos</h3>   
      <p><a href="https://www.explorelearning.com/">Gizmos</a> are online interactive simulations of math and science concepts. Students can manipulate equations, graphs, shapes, and data and get immediate results. These simulations are great for topics that involve a lot of visualization, because they can be difficult for students to grasp by just reading about them or looking at images of them. Exploring these simulations is inquiry-based learning, which is an effective way for many students to learn mathematics.</p>

      <br />
      
      <h3>Kahoot!</h3>   
      <p><a href="https://getkahoot.com/">Kahoots</a> are competitive quiz games in which students score points based on how quickly they answer questions correctly. The results of each game, including each students' individual answers, can be downloaded and reviewed by the teacher. I was initially concerned about using Kahoot for reviewing concepts because I figured that it could upset students who were performing poorly in the course. However, when I first tried it, I was surprised at how excited all students became. When the game started, it instantly got very competitive. Students were having fun trying to sabotage each other by calling out incorrect answers, and they celebrated when they passed each others' scores. </p>
      <p>It was certainly entertaining, although I felt it didn't help too much as a review session, since many students were simply copying answers off their peers or were making quick guesses hoping to luck out and catch up. I was expecting this to be a good opportunity to determine what students were struggling with the most, but based on how they were playing, I took the results with a grain of salt. Furthermore, since many of the students entered nicknames not resembling their real names, I couldn't always tell whose results were whose, so I got only general information on which questions students found easiest.</p>
      <p>The most common request students made in all of my practica was: "Can we play Kahoot more often?". I made it a tradition to play Kahoot on my last day of class using trivia questions about the subject. This way, students who did poorly would know that it was not a poor reflection of their abilities, since all students were mostly guessing answers.</p>

      <br />
      
      <h3>Nearpod</h3>   
      <p><a href="https://nearpod.com/">Nearpod</a> is an interactive presentation tool in which students follow along with the presentation on their devices. Teachers can create presentations with slides, videos, images, quizzes, polls, and open questions, and can see students' responses as they are being submitted. I have used it in grade 9 and 10 applied classes to gain a lot of insight about their learning throughout the activities. I think the neatest feature is the ability to share students' responses anonymously. When students submit their responses, I can share a response so that all students can see it on their screens and have discussions about the response. Students get excited when their own responses are being shared.</p>
      <p>I find that the most useful part of using Nearpod is the data that is collected throughout a presentation. It is a great assessment tool, since all the students' responses are neatly organized into tables. I can also see which student gave which responses since they were required to enter their real name, which showed up only in the presentation report, and a nickname, which showed up only during the presentation.</p>
      <p>I also found that students like answering questions using this kind of software on their iPads a lot more than doing worksheets or writing on the whiteboard. The feature I use the most is "Draw It", in which students draw on their screens with their fingertips. Since it is a teacher-paced presentation (every student is on the same activity at the same time), this keeps the whole class engaged since everyone is on the same short task at a given time.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Socrative</h3>   
      <p><a href="https://socrative.com/">Socrative</a> is a student-paced online quizzing tool. I have used it for diagnostic assessments by asking questions to students about what they struggled with most, what they understood most, and what they wanted to review most. I get useful information on what the students believed they remember the least and most about, which I use to create review activities for the subsequent lessons.</p>

  <div class="flipped-classroom-philosophy section">
    <h2 class="append-title">Flipped Classroom Philosophy</h2>
    
    <p>"Flipping the classroom" in a nutshell is "[d]irect instruction delivered to the individual outside of class, and more strategic use of in-class time for group work and individualized attention" (Bergmann & Sams, 2014, p. xi). It has been a recurring topic in the courses in our B.Ed. program and all I have heard about it are positive remarks. However, on my previous practicum when I taught Grade 10 Applied Mathematics, my associate teacher gave me some suggestions including flipping the classroom and my first instinct was that it was not going to work well. Even now after doing some research on flipping the classroom I still believe that it would not have worked well for that class. 
    <p>In <i>Flip Your Classroom</i> by Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams, who were pioneers in developing the flipped classroom model (Bergmann & Sams, 2014, p. xi), they say that only teachers themselves can determine whether flipping the classroom is the best approach for their students (Bergmann & Sams, 2012, p. ix). I quickly dismissed flipping the classroom on my practicum for one main reason: the majority of students never did their homework and this would defeat the purpose of the model. However, as I read <i>Flip Your Classroom</i> I realized that this issue can be mostly "fixed" but there was a different major reason as to why flipping the classroom would have not worked well for my grade 10s.
    <p>Bergmann and Sams' solution to students not watching the assigned videos was to allow them to use the few computers in their classroom during class to watch them. In my practicum placement, out of the 45 students there were less than 10 who regularly did homework, but since the department had class sets of iPads, all the nonviewing students would be able to view it during class. Something I did not consider until I read <i>Flip Your Classroom</i> was that if homework is simpler and takes a fixed amount of time, this should motivate students to make doing homework a regular habit. "Often, students get home and are lost because they didn't understand what happened in class. Students are simply building foundation by watching the videos; when they come to class they can go deeper and further into their learning" (Bergmann & Sams, 2014, p. 19). They also noticed that nonviewing students quickly changed their homework habits after realized that they would benefit from having the teacher as a resource when working on their assignments in class (Bergmann & Sams, 2012, pp. 98-99). Flipping the classroom may have motivated many of my grade 10s to improve their learning skills including getting in the habit of completing homework, which in turn would allow them to get more out of their classes.</p>
    <p>Despite these realizations, there was still one major issue. The main reason why I still do not think flipping the classroom would have been suitable for my grade 10s is that obtaining content through videos or other means would have not appealed to their different learning styles. Most of them were kinesthetic learners and may have not found videos engaging. Bergmann and Sams are high school chemistry teachers who originally spent most their classes talking at their students about the content (Bergmann & Sams, 2012, p. 19), and so it was very true when they said "[students] don't need [us] in the room with them to yak at them and give them content; they can receive content on their own" (Bergmann & Sams, 2012, p. 4). However, I never lectured at my grade 10s and instead had them do various hands-on activities, mostly in groups, to investigate the content. Also, for many of the activities, if students came to class knowing the content, it would spoil many of the surprises and revelations that they would make in class. Grade 10 Applied Mathematics is not a content-heavy course, so there was plenty of class time for students to both investigate and practice the content.</p>
    <p>Bergmann and Sams also brought up the notion of a flipped-mastery program, which "takes the principles of mastery learning and marries them with modern technology" (Bergmann & Sams, 2012, p. 53). "The basic idea of mastery learning is for students to learn a series of objectives at their own pace. Instead of all students working on the same topics at the same time, all of them work towards predetermined objectives" (Bergmann & Sams, 2012, pp. 51-52). Bergmann and Sams ultimately adopted the flipped-mastery model for their classrooms with great success, but I can say without a doubt that it would have been disastrous for my grade 10s. Most of their favourite things they did in class were group activities because many of them were very good friends with each other. Being able to share ideas and findings and help each other made the class enjoyable. If every student worked at their own pace, they probably would have been bored and discouraged since they cannot always work alongside their friends.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, one should not flip the classroom simply because it is a revolutionary idea that other teachers have been very successful with. There are plenty of great reasons to flip a classroom including: allowing students of all abilities to excel, increasing student-teacher and student-student interactions, changing classroom management, educating parents, and potentially leading to a flipped-mastery program (Bergmann & Sams, 2012, pp. 19-33), however there are also flaws that teachers should be mindful of. Many of the pitfalls such as students not having access to Internet at home can be resolved if the flipped classroom model is implemented in a way based on the students' needs, but there are still flaws that will exist no matter how it is implemented. Not every student can easily learn content individually outside of class, and some may be overwhelmed by the student-centered nature of the class. Traditional lessons have their merits as long as they are based on students' needs, and a flipped classroom is not always necessary to make the most out of class time.</p>

    <h2 class="append-title">Experience With Flipped Classrooms</h2>
    
    <p>I assisted in a grade 12 advanced functions class that used the flipped classroom model. The students were initially skeptical about it due to another teacher at the school who implemented the model poorly. That teacher gave traditional homework in addition to having students learn content at home and working on problems in class, and so many of the students were overwhelmed by the amount of the work they were responsible for. In the class I was in, all of the course content was on D2L, which students could learn from entirely at their own pace on a unit basis.</p>
    <p>Students spent class time watching videos, reading online textbooks, doing online quizzes, and doing practice questions. There was a class set of iPads that were always available for students to use. They were responsible for learning an entire unit before the day of the unit test, which they decided on as a class. Students often discussed the content in groups and helped each other on practice questions. My Associate Teacher and I were available for help. Despite the lack of traditional instruction, it was a very productive learning environment.</p>
    <p>There were a few times when there were some difficult concepts many students were stuck with, and so I delivered lectures about them to the entire class using the whiteboard. Many students expressed that they liked having the content taught in a variety of ways: videos, textbooks, and my lectures because if they didn't fully understand something from one source, they can relearn it from another.</p>
    <p>Here are some opinions that student in the advanced functions class wrote about the flipped classroom model.</p>
