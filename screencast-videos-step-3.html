<p>Here are some things you can do with video editing software after you finished recording. </p>

<br />

<h3>Trimming</h3>
<p>If you don't start the lesson immediately when the screen recording starts or you take a while to turn it off at the end, you may want to trim the beginning and/or end of the video. You can also cut out mistakes and long pauses in the video.</p>

<br />

<h3>Zooming</h3>
<p>If you captured your entire screen or a large portion of your screen, but only used part of it, you can zoom in to the part of the screen that you used. You can also zoom in and out of parts of the screen to redirect the students' focus.</p>

<br />

<h3>Adding titles and annotations</h3>
<p>You can annotate your video by adding text to reinforce parts of the lesson.</p>

<br />

<h3>Adding images</h3>
<p>You can add smaller images on top of the recording to reinforce parts of the lesson.</p>

<br />

<h3>Adding other videos</h3>
<p>You can add video clips in the middle of the recording to reinforce parts of the lesson. You can use <a href="http://www.youtubedownloaderhd.com/">YouTube Downloader</a> to download videos from YouTube to import into your video editing software.</p>
<p>If you recorded yourself with a webcam, you can place the webcam recording in a corner of the screen throughout the video.</p>
